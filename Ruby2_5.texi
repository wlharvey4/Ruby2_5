@node Overview
@unnumberedsec What Is Covered

Text and chapter by chapter description here.

@node Conventions
@unnumberedsec Typographical Conventions

@c Copied mostly verbatim from the gawk manual.

@cindex Texinfo document formatting language
This @value{DOCUMENT} is written in an enhanced version of
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/, Texinfo},
the GNU documentation formatting language.
A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online
versions of a program's documentation.
@ifnotinfo
Because of this, the typographical conventions
are slightly different than in other books you may have read.
@end ifnotinfo

Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common
shell primary and secondary prompts, @samp{$} and @samp{>}.  Input that
you type is shown @kbd{like this}.  Output from the command is preceded
by the glyph ``@print{}''.  This typically represents the command's
standard output.  Error messages, and other output on the command's
standard error, are preceded by the glyph ``@error{}''.  For example:

@example
$ @kbd{echo hi on stdout}
@print{} hi on stdout
$ @kbd{echo hello on stderr 1>&2}
@error{} hello on stderr
@end example

@ifnotinfo
In the text, command names appear in @code{this font}, while code segments
appear in the same font and quoted, @samp{like this}.  Options look
like this: @option{-f}.  Some things are emphasized @emph{like this},
and if a point needs to be made strongly, it is done @strong{like this}.
The first occurrence of a new term is usually its @dfn{definition} and
appears in the same font as the previous occurrence of ``definition''
in this sentence.  Finally, file names are indicated like this:
@file{/path/to/our/file}.
@end ifnotinfo

@node Installing Ruby
@section Installing Ruby

@subheading Installation Methods

There are several ways to install Ruby:

@itemize
@item
@b{Package Manager}: When you are on a UNIX-like operating system,
using your system’s package manager is the easiest way of getting
started. However, the packaged Ruby version usually is not the newest
one.
@item
@b{Installers}: can be used to install a specific or multiple Ruby
versions. There is also an installer for Windows.
@item
@b{Managers} help you to switch between multiple Ruby installations on
your system.
@item
@b{Source}: And finally, you can also build Ruby from source.
@end itemize

The following overview lists available installation methods for
different needs and platforms.

@node Package Management Systems
@subsection Package Management Systems

If you cannot compile your own Ruby, and you do not want to use a
third-party tool, you can use your system’s package manager to install
Ruby.

Certain members in the Ruby community feel very strongly that you
should never use a package manager to install Ruby and that you should
use tools instead.  While the full list of pros and cons is outside of
the scope of this page, the most basic reason is that most package
managers have older versions of Ruby in their official
repositories.  If you would like to use the newest Ruby, make sure you
use the correct package name, or use the tools described further below
instead.

@c _____________________________________

@menu
* Homebrew (OS X)::
@end menu

@node Homebrew (OS X)
@subsubsection Homebrew (OS X)

@url{http://brew.sh/, Homebrew}

On macOS (High) Sierra and OS X El Capitan, Ruby 2.0 is included.

Many people on OS X use Homebrew as a package manager.  It is really
easy to get a newer version of Ruby using Homebrew:

@example
$ brew install ruby
@end example

This should install the latest Ruby version.


@c .....................................

@node Installers
@subsection Installers
@cindex installer, third party
@cindex version managers
@cindex versions,multiple
@cindex Rubies, switch between
@cindex RVM version manager

If the version of Ruby provided by your system or package manager is
out of date, a newer one can be installed using a third-party
installer.  Some of them also allow you to install multiple versions on
the same system; associated managers can help to switch between the
different Rubies.  If you are planning to use RVM as a version manager
you do not need a separate installer, it comes with its own.

@command{ruby-install} allows you to compile and install different
versions of Ruby into arbitrary directories.  There is also a sibling,
@command{chruby} (@pxref{chruby}), which handles switching between
Ruby versions.  It is available for OS X, Linux, and other UNIX-like
operating systems.


@c .....................................

@node Managers
@subsection Managers

Many Rubyists use Ruby managers to manage multiple Rubies.  They confer
various advantages but are not officially supported.  Their respective
communities are very helpful, however.

@url{https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#ruby-build,
@command{ruby-build}}

@command{rbenv} allows you to manage multiple installations of Ruby.
It does not support installing Ruby, but there is a popular plugin
named @command{ruby-build} (@pxref{ruby-build}) to install Ruby.  Both
tools are available for OS X, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating
systems.

@c _____________________________________

@node RVM (``Ruby Version Manager'')
@subsubsection RVM (``Ruby Version Manager'')
@cindex multiple installations, manage using RVM
@cindex gemsets, manage different using RVM

@url{http://rvm.io/, RVM}

RVM allows you to install and manage multiple installations of Ruby on
your system.  It can also manage different gemsets.  It is available for
OS X, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating systems.

@c .....................................

@node Building From Source
@subsection Building From Source
@cindex source, building

@url{https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/, Ruby 2.5.1}

@url{https://github.com/ruby/ruby, Ruby Github}

Of course, you can install Ruby from source.  Download and unpack a
tarball, then just do this:

@example
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
@end example

By default, this will install Ruby into @file{/usr/local}.  To change, pass
the @option{--prefix=DIR} option to the @file{./configure} script.

Using the third-party tools or package managers might be a better
idea, though, because the installed Ruby won’t be managed by any
tools.

Installing from the source code is a great solution for when you are
comfortable enough with your platform and perhaps need specific settings for
your environment.  It’s also a good solution in the event that there are no
other premade packages for your platform.

Now is a fantastic time to follow Ruby’s development.  With the increased
attention Ruby has received in the past few years, there’s a growing need for
good talent to help enhance Ruby and document its parts.  So, where do you
start?

@subheading Ruby Core

The topics related to Ruby development covered here are:

@itemize
@item
@ref{subversion, Using Subversion to Track Ruby Development}

@end itemize

@anchor{subversion}
@subsubheading Using Subversion to Track Ruby Development
@cindex Subversion
@cindex track Ruby development
@cindex Ruby development, tracking

Getting the latest Ruby source code is a matter of an anonymous checkout from
the @url{http://subversion.apache.org/, Subversion} repository.  From your
command line:

@example
@kbd{$ svn co https://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby}
@end example

The @file{ruby} directory will now contain the latest source code for the
development version of Ruby (@file{ruby-trunk}).  Currently patches applied to
the trunk are backported to the stable 2.5, 2.4, and 2.3 branches (see below).

If you’d like to follow patching of Ruby 2.5, you should use the ruby_2_5
branch when checking out:
@cindex patching of Ruby

@example
$ svn co https://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/branches/ruby_2_5
@end example

This will check out the respective development tree into a @file{ruby_2_5}
directory. Developers working on the maintenance branches are expected to
migrate their changes to Ruby’s trunk, so often the branches are very similar,
with the exception of improvements made by Matz and Nobu to the language
itself.

If you prefer, you may browse
@url{https://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/, Ruby’s Subversion
repository via the web}.

commit access and @url{https://github.com/shyouhei/ruby/wiki/noncommitterhowto,
everybody else}.

The core team maintains an @url{https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/, issue tracker} for
submitting patches and bug reports to Matz and the gang.  These reports also
get submitted to the
@url{https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/, Ruby-Core mailing
list} for discussion, so you can be sure your request won’t go unnoticed.  You
can also send your patches straight to the mailing list.  Either way, you are
encouraged to take part in the discussion that ensues.

Please look over the
@url{https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/ruby-core/writing-patches/, Patch

considered.

@subsubsection FAQ Iterators
@cindex iterators

@subheading What is an iterator?
@cindex @file{Proc} object, passed to iterator
@cindex block object, passed to iterator

An iterator is a method which accepts a block or a @file{Proc}
object.  In the source file, the block is placed immediately after the
invocation of the method.  Iterators are used to produce user-defined
control structures --- especially loops.

Let’s look at an example to see how this works.  Iterators are often
used to repeat the same action on each element of a collection, like
this:

@example
data = [1, 2, 3]
data.each do |i|
  puts i
end
@end example

The @code{each} method of the array @code{data} is passed the @code{do
@dots{} end} block, and executes it repeatedly.  On each call, the
block is passed successive elements of the array.
@cindex @code{each} method of iterator

You can define blocks with @code{@{ @dots{} @}} in place of @code{do
@dots{} end}.

@example
data = [1, 2, 3]
data.each @{ |i|
  puts i
@}
@end example

This code has the same meaning as the last example.  However, in some
cases, precedence issues cause @code{do @dots{} end} and @code{@{
@dots{} @}} to act differently.
@cindex precedence, iterators, different results
@cindex binding of @code{@{ @dots{} @}}

@example
foobar a, b do @dots{} end	# foobar is the iterator.
foobar a, b @{ @dots{} @}	# b is the iterator.
@end example

This is because @code{@{ @dots{} @}} binds more tightly to the
preceding expression than does a @code{do @dots{} end} block.  The
first example is equivalent to @samp{foobar(a, b) do @dots{} end},
while the second is @samp{foobar(a, b @{ @dots{} @})}.

@subheading How can I pass a block to an iterator?

You simply place the block after the iterator call.  You can also pass
a @file{Proc} object by prepending @kbd{&} to the variable or constant
name that refers to the @file{Proc}.

@subheading How is a block used in an iterator?
@cindex block, used in an iterator
@cindex iterator, block
@cindex @code{yield} control structor, or statement

@emph{This section or parts of it might be out-dated or in need of
confirmation.}

There are three ways to execute a block from an iterator method:

@enumerate
@item
the @code{yield} control structure;
@cindex @code{yield} control structure in iterator

The @code{yield} statement calls the block, optionally passing it one
or more arguments.

@example
def my_iterator
  yield 1, 2
end

my_iterator @{|a, b| puts a, b @}
@end example

@item
calling a @file{Proc} argument (made from a block) with @code{call};

If a method definition has a block argument (the last formal parameter
has an ampersand (@kbd{&}) prepended), it will receive the attached
block, converted to a @file{Proc} object. This may be called using
@code{prc.call(args)}.

@example
def my_iterator(&b)
  b.call(1, 2)
end

my_iterator @{|a, b| puts a, b @}
@end example

and

@item
using @code{Proc.new} followed by a @code{call}.
@cindex @code{Proc.new}, followed by @code{call}
@cindex @code{lambda} as a synonym of @file{Proc}

@code{Proc.new} (or the equivalent @code{proc} or @code{lambda}
calls), when used in an iterator definition, takes the block which is
given to the method as its argument and generates a procedure object
from it.  (@code{proc} and @code{lambda} are effectively synonyms.)

@emph{[Update needed: @code{lambda} behaves in a slightly different
way and produces a warning @samp{tried to create Proc object without a
block}.]}

@example
def my_iterator
  Proc.new.call(3, 4)
  proc.call(5, 6)
  lambda.call(7, 8)
end

my_iterator @{|a, b| puts a, b @}
@end example

Perhaps surprisingly, @code{Proc.new} and friends do not in any sense
consume the block attached to the method --- each call to
@code{Proc.new} generates a new procedure object out of the same
block.

You can tell if there is a block associated with a method by calling
@code{block_given?}.
@cindex @code{block_given?}

@end enumerate

@subheading What does Proc.new without a block do?

@code{Proc.new} without a block cannot generate a procedure object and
an error occurs.  In a method definition, however, @code{Proc.new}
without a block implies the existence of a block at the time the
method is called, and so no error will occur.

@subheading How can I run iterators in parallel?

@anchor{immediate value}
@subheading What is the difference between an immediate value and a reference?
@cindex immediate values

@code{Fixnum}, @code{true}, @code{nil}, and @code{false} are
implemented as @dfn{immediate values}.  With immediate values,
variables hold the objects themselves, rather than references to them.

Singleton methods cannot be defined for such objects.  Two
@file{Fixnums} of the same value always represent the same object
instance, so (for example) instance variables for the @file{Fixnum}
with the value 1 are shared between all the 1's in the system.  This
makes it impossible to define a singleton method for just one of
these.

@anchor{nil vs false}
@subheading What is the difference between @code{nil} and @code{false}?
@cindex @code{nil} and @code{false}, similariaties and differences
@cindex @code{false} and @code{nil}
@cindex boolean context
@cindex ``falsey'' values
@cindex ``truthy'' values

First the similarity: @code{nil} and @code{false} are the only two
objects that evaluate to @code{false} in a boolean context.  (In other
words: they are the only ``falsy'' values; all other objects are
``truthy''.)

However, @code{nil} and @code{false} are instances of different
classes (@file{NilClass} and @file{FalseClass}), and have different behavior
elsewhere.
@cindex @file{NilClass}
@cindex @file{FalseClass}

We recommend that @dfn{predicate methods} (those whose name ends with
a question mark) return @code{true} or @code{false}.  Other methods that need to
indicate failure should return @code{nil}.
@cindex predicate methods

@anchor{empty string}
@subheading The Empty String
@cindex empty string
@cindex conditional expression, @code{false} values

An empty string (@code{""}) returns @code{true} in a conditional
expression!  In Perl, it’s @code{false}.  It’s very simple: in Ruby,
only @code{nil} and @code{false} are @code{false} in conditional
contexts.

You can use @code{empty?}, compare the string to @code{""}, or compare
the string’s size or length to 0 to find out if a string is empty.

@anchor{symbol object}
@subheading A Symbol Object
@cindex Symbol object
@cindex @code{"name".to_sym}
@cindex @code{"name".intern}

What does @code{:name} mean?

A colon followed by a name generates a @dfn{Symbol object} which
corresponds one-to-one with the identifier.  During the duration of a
program's execution the same Symbol object will be created for a given
name or string.  Symbols can also be created with @code{"name".intern}
or @code{"name".to_sym}.

Symbol objects can represent identifiers for methods, variables, and
so on.  Some methods, like @code{define_method},
@code{method_missing}, or @code{trace_var}, require a symbol.  Other
methods, e.g. @code{attr_accessor}, @code{send}, or @code{autoload},
also accept a string.

Due to the fact that they are created only once, Symbols are often
used as hash keys.  String hash keys would create a new object for
every single use, thereby causing some memory overhead.  There is even
a special syntax for symbol hash keys:
@cindex symbols as hash keys

@example
person_1 = @{ :name => "John", :age => 42 @}
person_2 = @{ name: "Jane", age: 24 @}        # alternate syntax
@end example

Symbols can also be used as enumeration values or to assign unique
values to constants:
@cindex symbols as enumeration values
@cindex symbols, unique constants

@example
status = :open  # :closed, ...

NORTH = :NORTH
SOUTH = :SOUTH
@end example

@anchor{value of symbol}
@subheading How can I access the value of a symbol?
@cindex symbol, access value of
@cindex @code{symbol.to_s}
@cindex @code{"#symbol"}
@cindex @code{eval}

To get the value of the variable corresponding to a symbol, you can
use @code{symbol.to_s} or @code{"#@{symbol@}"} to get the name of the
variable, and then @code{eval} that in the scope of the symbol to get
the variable’s contents:

@example
a = "This is the content of `a'"
b = eval("#@{:a@}")
a.object_id == b.object_id  # => true
@end example

You can also use:

@example
b = binding.local_variable_get(:a)
@end example
@cindex @code{binding.local_variable_get(:symbol)}

If your symbol corresponds to the name of a method, you can use
@code{send}:
@cindex @code{send}

@example
class Demo
  def hello
    "Hello, world"
  end
end

demo = Demo.new
demo.send(:hello)
@end example

Or you can use @code{Object#method} to return a corresponding @file{Method}
object, which you may then call:

@example
m = demo.method(:hello)  # => #<Method: Demo#hello>
m.call                   # => "Hello, world"
@end example

@anchor{loop}
@subheading Is @code{loop} a control structure?
@cindex @code{loop}
@cindex @file{Kernel}

Although @code{loop} looks like a control structure, it is actually a
method defined in @file{Kernel}.  The block which follows introduces a
new scope for local variables.

@anchor{post-test loop}
@subheading Ruby doesn’t have a post-test loop
@cindex @code{do @dots{} @} while}

Ruby does not have a @code{do @{ @dots{} @} while} construct, so how
can I implement loops that test the condition at the end?

Clemens Hintze says: ``You can use a combination of Ruby’s @code{begin
@dots{} end} and the @code{while} or @code{until} statement modifiers
to achieve the same effect:

@example
i = 0
begin
  puts "i = #@{i@}"
  i += 1
end until i > 4
@end example

@anchor{hash literal}
@subheading Why can’t I pass a hash literal to a method: @code{p @{@}}?

The @code{@{@}} is parsed as a block, not a @file{Hash} constructor.
You can force the @code{@{@}} to be treated as an expression by making
the fact that it's a parameter explicit: @code{p(@{@})}.

@anchor{pos val}
@subheading I can’t get @code{def pos=(val)} to work!

I have the following code, but I cannot use the method @code{pos = 1}.

@example
def pos=(val)
  @@pos = val
  puts @@pos
end
@end example

Methods with @kbd{=} appended must be called with an explicit receiver
(without the receiver, you are just assigning to a local
variable).  Invoke it as @code{self.pos = 1}.

@anchor{\1 and \\1}
@subheading What is the difference between @code{\1} and @code{\\1}?

They have the same meaning.  In a single quoted string, only @code{\'}
and @code{\\} are transformed and other combinations remain unchanged.

However, in a double quoted string, @code{"\1"} is the byte
@code{\001} (an octal bit pattern), while @code{"\\1"} is the two
character string containing a backslash and the character @code{"1"}.

@anchor{2 dots vs 3 dots}
@subheading What is the difference between @code{..} and @code{...}?
@cindex @code{..} vs. @code{...}
@cindex range operators @code{..} vs @code{...}

@code{..} includes the right hand side in the range, while @code{...}
does not:

@example
(5..8).to_a   # => [5, 6, 7, 8]
(5...8).to_a  # => [5, 6, 7]
@end example

@anchor{or and}
@subheading What is the difference between @code{or} and @code{||}?
@cindex precedence of @code{or}

@code{p(nil || "Hello")} prints @code{"Hello"}, while @code{p(nil or
"Hello")} gives a parse error.  Why?

@code{or} has a very low precedence; @code{p( (nil or "Hello") )} will
work.

The precedence of @code{or} is for instance also lower than that of @code{=},
whereas @code{ || } has a higher precedence:

@example
foo = nil || "Hello"  # parsed as: foo = (nil || "Hello")
foo  # => "Hello"

# but perhaps surprisingly:

foo = nil or "Hello"  # parsed as: (foo = nil) or "Hello"
foo  # => nil
@end example

@code{or} (and similarly @code{and}) is best used, not for combining
boolean expressions, but for control flow, like in:

@example
do_something  or raise "some error!"
@end example

where @code{do_something} returns @code{false} or @code{nil} when an
error occurs.

@anchor{function pointers}
@subheading Does Ruby have function pointers?
@cindex function pointers

A @file{Proc} object generated by @code{Proc.new}, @code{proc}, or
@code{lambda} can be referenced from a variable, so that variable
could be said to be a function pointer.  You can also get references to
methods within a particular object instance using @code{object.method}.

@anchor{load vs require}
@subheading What is the difference between load and require?
@cindex @command{load}
@cindex @command{require}

@command{load} will load and execute a Ruby program (@file{*.rb}).

@command{require} loads Ruby programs as well, but will also load
@dfn{binary Ruby extension modules} (shared libraries or DLLs).  In
addition, @command{require} ensures that a feature is never loaded
more than once.
@cindex binary Ruby extension modules
@cindex shared libraries
@cindex DLLs

@anchor{exception handling}
@subheading Does Ruby have exception handling?
@cindex exception handling

Ruby supports a flexible exception handling scheme:

@example
begin
  statements which may raise exceptions
rescue [exception class names]
  statements when an exception occurred
rescue [exception class names]
  statements when an exception occurred
ensure
  statements that will always run
end
@end example
@cindex @code{rescue} clause
@cindex @code{ensure} clause

If an exception occurs in the @code{begin} clause, the @code{rescue}
clause with the matching exception name is executed.  The
@code{ensure} clause is executed whether an exception occurred or not.
@code{rescue} and @code{ensure} clauses may be omitted.

If no exception class is designated for a @code{rescue} clause,
@file{StandardError} exception is implied, and exceptions which are in
a @code{is_a?} relation to @file{StandardError} are captured.

This expression returns the value of the @code{begin} clause.

The latest exception is accessed by the global variable @code{$!} (and
so its type can be determined using @code{$!.type}).

@node Interactive Ruby
@subsubsection Interactive Ruby
@cindex @command{irb}

Ruby comes with a program that will show the results of any Ruby statements you
feed it.  Playing with Ruby code in interactive sessions like this is a terrific
way to learn the language.

Open up @file{IRB} (which stands for Interactive Ruby).

@example
? irb
@print{} irb(main):001:0>

irb(main):001:0> "Hello World"
@result{} "Hello World"
@print{} irb(main):002:0>
@end example

The second line is just IRB’s way of telling us the result of the last
expression it evaluated.  To print:

@example
irb(main):002:0> puts "Hello World"
@print{} Hello World
@result{} nil
@print{} irb(main):003:0>
@end example

@command{puts} is the basic command to print something out in Ruby.  But then
what’s the @samp{=> nil} bit?  That’s the result of the expression.
@command{puts} always returns @code{nil}, which is Ruby’s
absolutely-positively-nothing value.

@c _____________________________________

@node Defining Methods
@subsubsection Defining Methods
@cindex methods, defining
@cindex @code{def}

Define a method:

@example
irb(main):010:0> def hi
irb(main):011:1> puts "Hello World!"
irb(main):012:1> end
=> :hi
@end example

The code @samp{def hi} starts the definition of the method.  The next line is
the body of the method.  Finally, the last line end tells Ruby we’re done
defining the method.  Ruby’s response @print{} @code{=> :hi} tells us that it
knows we're done defining the method.

Try running that method a few times:

@example
irb(main):013:0> hi
Hello World!
=> nil
irb(main):014:0> hi()
Hello World!
=> nil
@end example
@cindex method, invoking
@cindex parentheses, optional

If the method doesn't take parameters that's all you need.  You can add empty
parentheses if you’d like, but they’re not needed.

@subsubheading Define Method with a Parameter
@cindex method parameters
@cindex parameters, methods

What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just
redefine @code{hi} to take a name as a parameter.

@example
irb(main):015:0> def hi(name)
irb(main):016:1> puts "Hello #@{name@}!"

irb(main):018:0> hi("Matz")
Hello Matz!

@end example
@cindex insert code into a string

What's the @code{#@{name@}} bit?  That's Ruby's way of inserting something into
a string.  The bit between the braces is turned into a string (if it isn’t one
already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point.  You can also
use this to make sure that someone's name is properly capitalized:

@example
irb(main):019:0> def hi(name = "World")
irb(main):020:1> puts "Hello #@{name.capitalize@}!"
irb(main):021:1> end
=> :hi
irb(main):022:0> hi "chris"
Hello Chris!
=> nil
irb(main):023:0> hi
Hello World!
=> nil
@end example
@cindex parentheses, optional

A couple of other tricks to spot here.  One is that we're calling the method
without parentheses again.  If it's obvious what you’re doing, the parentheses
are optional.  The other trick is the default parameter World. What this is
saying is ``If the name isn't supplied, use the default name of "World"''.

@subheading Create a Class
@cindex class definition
@cindex @code{class} keyword

What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and
welcomes you and treats you always with respect.  You might want to use an
object for that.  Let’s create a “Greeter” class.

@example
irb(main):024:0> class Greeter
irb(main):025:1>   def initialize(name = "World")
irb(main):026:2>     @@name = name
irb(main):027:2>   end
irb(main):028:1>   def say_hi
irb(main):029:2>     puts "Hi #@{@@name@}!"
irb(main):030:2>   end
irb(main):031:1>   def say_bye
irb(main):032:2>     puts "Bye #@{@@name@}, come back soon."
irb(main):033:2>   end
irb(main):034:1> end
=> :say_bye
@end example
@cindex instance variable

The new keyword here is @code{class}.  This defines a new class called
@file{Greeter} and a bunch of methods for that class.  Also notice
@code{@@name}.  This is an instance variable, and is available to all the
methods of the class.  As you can see it’s used by @code{say_hi} and
@code{say_bye}.

@subheading Create an Object
@cindex object, create from class definition

Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:

@example
irb(main):035:0> greeter = Greeter.new("Pat")
=> #<Greeter:0x16cac @@name="Pat">
irb(main):036:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Pat!
=> nil
irb(main):037:0> greeter.say_bye
Bye Pat, come back soon.
=> nil
@end example

@subheading Instance Variables
@cindex instance variables, encapsulation

Instance variables are hidden away inside the object.  They’re not terribly
hidden, you see them whenever you inspect the object, and there are other ways
of accessing them, but Ruby uses the good object-oriented approach of keeping
data sort-of hidden away.

So what methods do exist for Greeter objects?

@samp{Object#instance_methods}
@cindex @code{Object#instance_methods}

@example
irb(main):039:0> Greeter.instance_methods
=> [:say_hi, :say_bye, :instance_of?, :public_send,
    :instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set,
    :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable,
    :private_methods, :kind_of?, :instance_variables, :tap,
    :is_a?, :extend, :define_singleton_method, :to_enum,
    :enum_for, :<=>, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :respond_to?,
    :freeze, :inspect, :display, :send, :object_id, :to_s,
    :method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :nil?, :hash,
    :class, :singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint,
    :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :trust, :untrusted?, :methods,
    :protected_methods, :frozen?, :public_methods, :singleton_methods,
    :!, :==, :!=, :__send__, :equal?, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__id__]
 @end example

We only defined two methods.  What’s going on here?  Well this is all of the
methods for Greeter objects, a complete list, including ones defined by
ancestor classes.  If we want to just list methods defined for Greeter we can
tell it to not include ancestors by passing it the parameter false, meaning we
don’t want methods defined by ancestors.

@samp{Object#instance_methods(false)}

@example
irb(main):040:0> Greeter.instance_methods(false)
=> [:say_hi, :say_bye]
@end example

So let’s see which methods our greeter object responds to:

@samp{Object#respond_to?}
@cindex @code{Object#respond_to?}

@example
irb(main):041:0> greeter.respond_to?("name")
=> false
irb(main):042:0> greeter.respond_to?("say_hi")
=> true
irb(main):043:0> greeter.respond_to?("to_s")
=> true
@end example

So, it knows @code{say_hi}, and @code{to_s} (meaning convert something to a
string, a method that's defined by default for every object), but it doesn't
know @code{name}.

@c _____________________________________

@node Altering Classes
@subsubsection Altering Classes

But what if you want to be able to view or change the name?  Ruby provides an
easy way of providing access to an object's variables.

@samp{attr_accessor :name}
@cindex @code{attr_accessor :name}

@example
irb(main):044:0> class Greeter
irb(main):045:1>   attr_accessor :name
irb(main):046:1> end
=> nil
@end example

In Ruby, you can open a class up again and modify it.  The changes will be
present in any new objects you create and even available in existing objects of
that class.  So, let’s create a new object and play with its @code{@@name}
property.
@cindex classes, modifying

@example
irb(main):047:0> greeter = Greeter.new("Andy")
=> #<Greeter:0x3c9b0 @@name="Andy">
irb(main):048:0> greeter.respond_to?("name")
=> true
irb(main):049:0> greeter.respond_to?("name=")
=> true
irb(main):050:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Andy!
=> nil
irb(main):051:0> greeter.name="Betty"
=> "Betty"
irb(main):052:0> greeter
=> #<Greeter:0x3c9b0 @@name="Betty">
irb(main):053:0> greeter.name
=> "Betty"
irb(main):054:0> greeter.say_hi
Hi Betty!
=> nil
@end example

Using @code{attr_accessor} defined two new methods for us, @code{name} to get
the value, and @code{name=} to set it.
@cindex @code{attr_accessor}, methods defined

@cindex respond to message, instance variable

The @code{say_hi} method has become a bit more complicated.  It now looks at
the @code{@@names} instance variable to make decisions.  If it's @code{nil}, it
just prints out three dots.  No point greeting nobody, right?

If the @code{@@names} object responds to each, it is something that you can
iterate over, so iterate over it and greet each person in turn.  Finally, if
@code{@@names} is anything else, just let it get turned into a string
automatically and do the default greeting.

@subsubheading The Iterator
@cindex iterator
@cindex block
@cindex @code{yield}

Let’s look at that iterator in more depth:

@example
@@names.each do |name|
  puts "Hello #@{name@}!"
end
@end example

@code{each} is a method that accepts a block of code then runs that block of
code for every element in a list, and the bit between @code{do} and @code{end}
is just such a block.  A @dfn{block} is like an anonymous function or lambda.
The variable between pipe characters is the parameter for this block.

What happens here is that for every entry in a list, @code{name} is bound to
that list element, and then the expression puts @samp{"Hello #@{name@}!"} is
run with that name.

Internally, the @code{each} method will essentially call @code{yield}
@samp{"Albert"}, then @code{yield} @samp{"Brenda"} and then @code{yield}
@samp{"Charles"}, and so on.

@subsubheading The Real Power of Blocks

The real power of blocks is when dealing with things that are more complicated
than lists.  Beyond handling simple housekeeping details within the method, you
can also handle setup, teardown, and errors—all hidden away from the cares of
the user.

@subheading @code{say_bye} Method
@cindex @code{join} method, respond to

The @code{say_bye} method doesn't use @code{each}; instead it checks to see if
@code{@@names} @dfn{responds} to the @code{join} method, and if so, uses
it.  Otherwise, it just prints out the variable as a string.

@subsubheading Duck Typing
@cindex duck typing

This method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on
what methods it supports is known as @dfn{Duck Typing}, as in ``if it walks like
a duck and quacks like a duck@dots{}''.  The benefit of this is that it doesn't
unnecessarily restrict the types of variables that are supported.  If someone
comes up with a new kind of list class, as long as it implements the
@code{join} method with the same semantics as other lists, everything will work
as planned.

@cindex @code{__FILE__} special variable
@cindex script code

There’s one final trick to notice, and that’s the line:

@example
if __FILE__ == $0
@end example

@var{__FILE__} is the magic variable that contains the name of the current
file.  $0 is the name of the file used to start the program.  This check says
``If this is the main file being used@dots{}''  This allows a file to be used
as a library, and not to execute code in that context, but if the file is being
used as an executable, then execute that code.

@subsubsection To Ruby From C and C++

@subheading Everything Is Differerent

It's difficult to write a bulleted list describing how your code will be
different in Ruby from C or C++ because it's quite a large difference.  One
reason is that the Ruby runtime does so much for you.  Ruby seems about as far
as you can get from C's ``no hidden mechanism'' principle---the whole point of
Ruby is to make the human's job easier at the expense of making the runtime
shoulder more of the work.

@subsubheading Ruby is Quicker to Code But Slower to Execute

That said, for one thing, you can expect your Ruby code to execute much more
slowly than ``equivalent'' C or C++ code.  At the same time, your head will spin
at how rapidly you can get a Ruby program up and running, as well as at how
few lines of code it will take to write it.  Ruby is much much simpler than
C++.

@subheading Dynamically Typed
@cindex dynamicly typed
@cindex statically typed

Ruby is dynamically typed, rather than statically typed---the runtime does as
much as possible at run-time.  For example, you don't need to know what
modules your Ruby program will ``link to'' (that is, load and use) or what
methods it will call ahead of time.

@subheading Extension Modules
@cindex extension modules

Happily, it turns out that Ruby and C have a healthy symbiotic relationship.
Ruby supports so-called @dfn{extension modules}.  These are modules that you
can use from your Ruby programs (and which, from the outside, will look and
act just like any other Ruby module), but which are written in C.  In this
way, you can compartmentalize the performance-critical parts of your Ruby
software, and smelt those down to pure C.

And, of course, Ruby itself is written in C.

@subheading Similarities With C

@itemize
@item
You may program procedurally if you like (but it will still be
object-oriented behind the scenes).
@item
Most of the operators are the same (including the compound assignment and
also bitwise operators).  Though, Ruby doesn’t have @code{++} or @code{--}.
@item
Ruby has @var{__FILE__} and @var{__LINE__}.
@item
You can also have constants, though there’s no special const keyword.
@code{Const}-ness is enforced by a naming convention instead --- names
starting with a capital letter are for constants.
@item
Strings go in double-quotes and are mutable
@item
Just like man pages, you can read most docs in your terminal window ---
though using the @command{ri} command.
@item
You’ve got the same sort of command-line debugger available.
@end itemize

@subheading Similarities with C++

@itemize
@item
You’ve got mostly the same operators (even @code{::}).  @code{<<} is often
used for appending elements to a list.  One note though: with Ruby you never
use @code{->} --- it's always just @code{.}.
@item
@code{public}, @code{private}, and @code{protected} do similar jobs.
@item
Inheritance syntax is still only one character, but it's @code{<} instead of
@code{:}.
@item
You may put your code into ``modules'', similar to how @code{namespace} in C++ is
used.
@item
Exceptions work in a similar manner, though the keyword names have been
changed to protect the innocent.
@end itemize

@subheading Differences From C
@cindex strongly typed objects

@itemize
@item
You don’t need to compile your code.  You just run it directly.
@item
Objects are strongly typed (and variable names themselves have no type at
all).
@item
There’s no macros or preprocessor; no casts; no pointers (nor pointer
arithmetic); no typedefs, sizeof, or enums.
@item
There are no header files.  You just define your functions (usually referred
to as ``methods'') and classes in the main source code files.
@item
There’s no @code{#define}.  Just use constants instead.
@item
@cindex heap
All variables live on the heap.  Further, you don’t need to free them
yourself --- the garbage collector takes care of that.
@item
Arguments to methods (i.e. functions) are passed by value, where the values
are always object references.
@item
It's @samp{require 'foo'} instead of @samp{#include <foo>} or @samp{#include
"foo"}.
@item
You cannot drop down to assembly.
@item
There’s no semicolons ending lines.
@item
You go without parentheses for @code{if} and @code{while} condition
expressions.
@cindex parentheses, none for condition expressions
@item
Parentheses for method (i.e. function) calls are often optional.
@cindex parentheses, optional for method calls
@item
You don’t usually use braces --- just end multi-line constructs (like
@code{while} loops) with an @code{end} keyword.
@cindex braces, none
@item
The @code{do} keyword is for so-called @dfn{blocks}.  There’s no ``do
statement'' like in C.
@cindex @code{do} keyword
@item
The term @dfn{block} means something different.  It's for a block of code
that you associate with a method call so the method body can call out to the
block while it executes.
@cindex block
@item
There are no variable declarations.  You just assign to new names on-the-fly
when you need them.
@item
When tested for truth, only @code{false} and @code{nil} evaluate to a
@code{false} value.  Everything else is true (including @code{0}, @code{0.0},
and @code{"0"}).
@cindex truth values
@item
There is no @code{char} --- they are just 1-letter strings.
@item
Strings don’t end with a null byte.
@item
Array literals go in brackets instead of braces.
@cindex array literals in brackets
@item
Arrays just automatically get bigger when you stuff more elements into them.
@cindex arrays are dynamic and mutable
@item
If you add two arrays, you get back a new and bigger array (of course,
allocated on the heap) instead of doing pointer arithmetic.
@cindex arrays, adding
@item
More often than not, everything is an expression (that is, things like
@code{while} statements actually evaluate to an @code{rvalue}).
@end itemize

@subheading Differences from C++

@itemize
@item
There’s no explicit references.  That is, in Ruby, every variable is just an
automatically dereferenced name for some object.
@item
Objects are strongly but @emph{dynamically} typed.  The runtime discovers
@emph{at runtime} if that method call actually works.
@cindex objects, strongly and dynamically typed

``Class'' (@code{static}) variable names always begin with @code{@@@@} (as in
@code{@@@@total_widgets}).

variables (known in Ruby as @dfn{attributes}) is via methods.
@cindex attributes

It's @code{self} instead of @code{this}.
@cindex object reference is @code{self}
@cindex @code{self}, object reference
@item
Some methods end in a @code{?} or a @code{!}.  It's actually part of the
method name.
@item
There's no multiple inheritance per se.  Though Ruby has @dfn{mixins}
(i.e. you can ``inherit'' all instance methods of a module).
@cindex multiple inheritance
@cindex mixins
@item
There are some enforced case-conventions (ex. class names start with a
capital letter, variables start with a lowercase letter).
@cindex case conventions, enforced
@item
Parentheses for method calls are usually optional.
@item
You can re-open a class anytime and add more methods.

There’s no need of C++ templates (since you can assign any kind of object to
a given variable, and types get figured out at runtime anyway).  No casting
either.
@cindex templates
@cindex cast
@item
Iteration is done a bit differently.  In Ruby, you don't use a separate
iterator object (like @code{vector<T>::const_iterator iter}).  Instead you use an
iterator method of the container object (like @code{each}) that takes a block of
code to which it passes successive elements.

There’s only two container types: @file{Array} and @file{Hash}.

There’s no type conversions.  With Ruby though, you’ll probably find that they
aren’t necessary.

@node To Ruby From Perl
@subsubsection To Ruby From Perl

Perl is awesome.  Perl's docs are awesome.  The Perl community is ---
awesome.  However, the language is fairly large and arguably complex.  For
those Perlers who long for a simpler time, a more orthogonal language, and
elegant OO features built-in from the beginning, Ruby may be for you.

@subheading Similarities with Perl

@itemize
@item
You’ve got a package management system, somewhat like CPAN (though it’s
called @url{http://guides.rubygems.org/,RubyGems}).
@item
Regexes are built right in.
@cindex regexes
@item
There's a fairly large number of commonly-used built-ins.
@item
Parentheses are often optional.
@item
Strings work basically the same.
@item
There’s a general delimited string and regex quoting syntax similar to
Perl’s.  It looks like @verb{|%q{this}|} (single-quoted), or
@verb{|%Q{this}|} (double-quoted), and @verb{|%w{this for a single-quoted
list of words}|}.  You @verb{|%Q|can||} @verb{|%Q(use)|} @verb{|%Q^other^|}
delimiters if you like.
@item
You’ve got double-quotish variable interpolation, though it @samp{"looks
#@{like@} this"} (and you can put any Ruby code you like inside that
@code{#@{@}}).
@item
Shell command expansion uses @code{`backticks`}.
@item
You’ve got embedded doc tools (Ruby’s is called @command{rdoc}).
@cindex @command{rdoc}
@cindex doc tools
@end itemize

@subheading Differences From Perl

@itemize
@item
You don’t have the context-dependent rules like with Perl.
@item
A variable isn't the same as the object to which it refers.  Instead, it's
always just a reference to an object.
@item
Although @code{$} and @code{@@} are used as the first character in variable
names sometimes, rather than indicating type, they indicate scope (@code{$}
for globals, @code{@@} for object instance, and @code{@@@@} for class
attributes).
@cindex sygils in Ruby
@item
Array literals go in brackets instead of parentheses.
@item
Composing lists of other lists does not flatten them into one big
list.  Instead you get an array of arrays.
@item
It's @code{def} instead of @code{sub}.
@item
There's no semicolons needed at the end of each line.  Incidentally, you end
things like function definitions, class definitions, and case statements with
the @code{end} keyword.
@item
Objects are strongly typed.  You’ll be manually calling @code{foo.to_i},
@code{foo.to_s}, etc., if you need to convert between types.
@item
There’s no @code{eq}, @code{ne}, @code{lt}, @code{gt}, @code{ge}, nor
@code{le}.
@item
There’s no diamond operator (@code{<>}).  You usually use
@code{IO.some_method} instead.
@item
The fat comma @code{=>} is only used for hash literals.
@item
There’s no @code{undef}.  In Ruby you have @code{nil}.  @code{nil} is an
object (like anything else in Ruby).  It's not the same as an undefined
variable.  It evaluates to @code{false} if you treat it like a boolean.
@item
When tested for truth, only @code{false} and @code{nil} evaluate to a
@code{false} value.  Everything else is @code{true} (including @code{0},
@code{0.0}, and @code{"0"}).

@node To Ruby From PHP
@subsubsection To Ruby From PHP

PHP is in widespread use for web applications, but if you want to use Ruby on
Rails or just want a language that’s more tailored for general use, Ruby is
worth a look.

@subheading Similarities with PHP

@itemize
@item
Ruby is dynamically typed, like in PHP, so you don’t need to worry about
having to declare variables.
@item
There are classes, and you can control access to them like in PHP 5 (public,
protected and private).
@item
Some variables start with @code{$}, like in PHP (but not all).
@item
There's @code{eval}, too.
@item
You can use string interpolation.  Instead of doing @samp{"$foo is a $bar"},
you can do @samp{"#@{foo@} is a #@{bar@}"} --- like in PHP, this doesn’t apply
for single-quoted strings.
@item
There’s heredocs.
@item
Ruby has exceptions, like PHP 5.
@item
There’s a fairly large standard library.
@item
Arrays and hashes work like expected, if you exchange @code{array()} for
@code{@{} and @code{@}}: @code{array('a' => 'b')} becomes @code{@{'a' =>
'b'@}}.
@item
@code{true} and @code{false} behave like in PHP, but @code{null} is called
@code{nil}.
@end itemize

@subheading Differences From PHP

@itemize
@item
There’s strong typing.  You’ll need to call @code{to_s}, @code{to_i} etc. to
convert between strings, integers and so on, instead of relying on the
language to do it.
@item
Strings, numbers, arrays, hashes, etc. are objects.  Instead of calling
@code{abs(-1)} it’s @code{-1.abs}.
@item
Parentheses are optional in method calls, except to clarify which parameters
go to which method calls.
@item
The standard library and extensions are organized in modules and classes.
@item
Reflection is an inherent capability of objects; you don’t need to use
@file{Reflection} classes like in PHP 5.
@item
Variables are references.
@item
There’s no @file{abstract} classes or @file{interfaces}.
@item
Hashes and arrays are not interchangeable.
@item
Only @code{false} and @code{nil} are false: @code{0}, @code{array()} and
@code{""} are all true in conditionals.
@item
Almost everything is a method call, even @code{raise} (@code{throw} in PHP).
@end itemize

@node To Ruby From Python
@subsubsection To Ruby From Python

Python is another very nice general purpose programming language.  Going from
Python to Ruby, you'll find that there's a little bit more syntax to learn
than with Python.

@subheading Similarities With Python

@itemize
@item
There’s an interactive prompt (called @command{irb}).
@cindex @command{irb}
@item
You can read docs on the command line (with the @command{ri} command instead
of @command{pydoc}).
@item
There are no special line terminators (except the usual newline).
@item
String literals can span multiple lines like Python's triple-quoted strings.
@item
Brackets are for lists, and braces are for dicts (which, in Ruby, are called
``hashes'').
@item
Arrays work the same (adding them makes one long array, but composing them
like this @samp{a3 = [ a1, a2 ]} gives you an array of arrays).
@item
Objects are strongly and dynamically typed.
@item
Everything is an object, and variables are just references to objects.
@item
Although the keywords are a bit different, exceptions work about the same.
@item
You’ve got embedded doc tools (Ruby’s is called @command{rdoc}).
@cindex @command{rdoc}
@cindex doc tools
@item
There is good support for functional programming with first-class functions,
anonymous functions, and closures.
@end itemize

@subheading Differences From Python

@itemize
@item
Strings are mutable.
@item
You can make constants (variables whose value you don’t intend to change).
@item
There are some enforced case-conventions (ex. class names start with a
capital letter, variables start with a lowercase letter).
@item
There's only one kind of list container (an @file{Array}), and it's mutable.
@item
Double-quoted strings allow escape sequences (like @code{\t}) and a special
``expression substitution'' syntax (which allows you to insert the results of
Ruby expressions directly into other strings without having to @samp{"add " +
"strings " + "together"}).  Single-quoted strings are like Python's @code{r"raw
strings"}.
@item
There are no ``new style'' and ``old style'' classes.  Just one kind.  (Python 3+
doesn’t have this issue, but it isn’t fully backward compatible with Python
2.)
@item
You never directly access attributes.  With Ruby, it’s all method calls.
@item
Parentheses for method calls are usually optional.
@item
There's @code{public}, @code{private}, and @code{protected} to enforce
access, instead of Python's @code{_voluntary_} underscore
@code{__convention__}.
@item
``mixins'' are used instead of multiple inheritance.
@item
You can add or modify the methods of built-in classes.  Both languages let you
open up and modify classes at any point, but Python prevents modification of
built-ins --- Ruby does not.
@item
You’ve got @code{true} and @code{false} instead of @code{True} and
@code{False} (and @code{nil} instead of @code{None}).
@item
When tested for truth, only @code{false} and @code{nil} evaluate to a
@code{false} value.  Everything else is @code{true} (including @code{0},
@code{0.0}, @code{""}, and @code{[]}).
@item
It's @code{elsif} instead of @code{elif}.
@item
It's @code{require} instead of @code{import}.  Otherwise though, usage is the
same.
@item
The usual-style comments on the line(s) above things (instead of docstrings
below them) are used for generating docs.
@item
There are a number of shortcuts that, although give you more to remember, you
quickly learn.  They tend to make Ruby fun and very productive.
@item
There’s no way to unset a variable once set (like Python's @code{del}
statement).  You can reset a variable to @code{nil}, allowing the old
contents to be garbage collected, but the variable will remain in the symbol
table as long as it is in scope.
@item
The @code{yield} keyword behaves differently.  In Python it will return
execution to the scope outside the function's invocation.  External code is
responsible for resuming the function.  In Ruby @code{yield} will execute
another function that has been passed as the final argument, then immediately
resume.
@item
Python supports just one kind of anonymous functions, lambdas, while Ruby
contains blocks, Procs, and lambdas.

Here are some pointers and hints on major Ruby features you'll see while

@end menu

@node Pointers on Iteration
@subsubsection Pointers on Iteration
@cindex iteration

Two Ruby features that are a bit unlike what you may have seen before, and
which take some getting used to, are ``blocks'' and iterators.  Instead of
looping over an index (like with C, C++, or pre-1.5 Java), or looping over a
list (like Perl's @code{for (@@a) @{@dots{}@}}, or Python's @code{for i in aList:
@dots{}}), with Ruby you'll very often instead see:

@example
some_list.each do |this_item|
  # We're inside the block.
  # deal with this_item.
end
@end example

For more info on @code{each} and its friends
@cindex @code{each}
@cindex @code{collect}
@cindex @code{find}
@cindex @code{inject}
@cindex @code{sort}

@itemize
@item
@code{collect},
@item
@code{find},
@item
@code{inject},
@item
@code{sort},
@end itemize

etc., see @command{ri Enumerable} (and then @command{ri
Enumerable#some_method}).
@cindex @command{ri}

@c _____________________________________

@node Everything has a value
@subsubsection Everything has a value
@cindex value, everthing has one

There’s no difference between an expression and a statement.  Everything has a
value, even if that value is @code{nil}.  This is possible:

@example
x = 10
y = 11
z = if x < y
      true
    else
      false
    end
z # => true
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Symbols are not lightweight Strings
@subsubsection Symbols are not lightweight Strings
@cindex symbols

Many Ruby newbies struggle with understanding what Symbols are, and what they
can be used for.

@dfn{Symbols} can best be described as identities.  A symbol is all about who it is,
not what it is.  Fire up @command{irb} and see the difference:

@example
irb(main):001:0> :george.object_id == :george.object_id
=> true
irb(main):002:0> "george".object_id == "george".object_id
=> false
irb(main):003:0>
@end example

The @code{object_id} methods returns the identity of an Object.  If two
objects have the same @code{object_id}, they are the same (point to the same
Object in memory).
@cindex @code{object_id} methods

As you can see, once you have used a Symbol once, any Symbol with the same
characters references the same Object in memory.  For any given two Symbols
that represent the same characters, the @code{object_id}s match.
@cindex Symbol

Now take a look at the String (@code{“george”}).  The @code{object_id}s don't
match.  That means they're referencing two different objects in memory.
Whenever you use a new String, Ruby allocates memory for it.

If you're in doubt whether to use a Symbol or a String, consider what’s more
important: the identity of an object (i.e. a Hash key), or the contents (in
the example above, @code{“george”}).
@cindex Symbol or String
@cindex String or Symbol

@c _____________________________________

@node Everything is an Object
@subsubsection Everything is an Object

@example
``Everything is an object'' isn't just hyperbole.  Even classes and integers are
objects, and you can do the same things with them as with any other object:

# This is the same as
# class MyClass
#   attr_accessor :instance_var
# end
MyClass = Class.new do
  attr_accessor :instance_var
end
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Variable Constants
@subsubsection Variable Constants

Constants are not really constant.  If you modify an already initialized
constant, it will trigger a warning, but not halt your program.  That isn't to
say you should redefine constants, though.

@c _____________________________________

@node Naming conventions
@subsubsection Naming conventions
@cindex conventions, naming

Ruby enforces some naming conventions.  If an identifier starts with a
capital letter, it is a constant.  If it starts with a dollar sign
(@code{$}), it is a global variable.  If it starts with @code{@@}, it is an
instance variable. If it starts with @code{@@@@}, it is a class variable.
@cindex constant naming convention
@cindex global variable @code{$}
@cindex varible, global @code{$}
@cindex instance variable @code{@@}
@cindex variable, instance @code{@@}
@cindex class variable @code{@@@@}
@cindex variable, class @code{@@@@}

Method names, however, are allowed to start with capital letters.  This can
lead to confusion, as the example below shows:

@example
Constant = 10
def Constant
  11
end
@end example

Now @code{Constant} is 10, but @code{Constant()} is 11.

@c _____________________________________

@node Keyword arguments
@subsubsection Keyword arguments

Like in Python, since Ruby 2.0 methods can be defined using keyword
arguments:

@example
def deliver(from: "A", to: nil, via: "mail")
  "Sending from #@{from@} to #@{to@} via #@{via@}."
end

deliver(to: "B")
# => "Sending from A to B via mail."
deliver(via: "Pony Express", from: "B", to: "A")
# => "Sending from B to A via Pony Express."
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node The universal truth
@subsubsection The universal truth

In Ruby, everything except @code{nil} and @code{false} is considered true.
In C, Python and many other languages, @code{0} and possibly other values,
such as empty lists, are considered false.  Take a look at the following
Python code (the example applies to other languages, too):

@example
# in Python
if 0:
  print("0 is true")
else:
  print("0 is false")
@end example

This will print @samp{“0 is false”}.  The equivalent Ruby:

@example
# in Ruby
if 0
  puts "0 is true"
else
  puts "0 is false"
end
@end example

Prints @samp{“0 is true”}.

@c _____________________________________

@node Access modifiers are Methods
@subsubsection Access modifiers are Methods
@cindex access modifiers @code{public}, @code{private}, @code{protected}
@cindex access modifier scope
@cindex scope, access modifiers

Access modifiers apply until the end of scope.

In the following Ruby code,

@example
class MyClass
  private
  def a_method; true; end
  def another_method; false; end
end
@end example

You might expect @code{another_method} to be public.  Not so.  The
@code{private} access modifier continues until the end of the scope, or until
another access modifier pops up, whichever comes first.  By default, methods
are public:

@example
class MyClass
  # Now a_method is public
  def a_method; true; end

  private

  # another_method is private
  def another_method; false; end
end
@end example

@itemize
@item
@code{public}, 
@item
@code{private} and
@item
@code{protected}
@end itemize

are really methods, so they can take parameters.  If you pass a Symbol to one
of them, that method’s visibility is altered.

@c _____________________________________

@node Method access
@subsubsection Method access

In Java, @code{public} means a method is accessible by
anyone. @code{protected} means the class's instances, instances of descendant
classes, and instances of classes in the same package can access it, but not
anyone else; and @code{private} means nobody besides the class's instances
can access the method.

Ruby differs slightly.  @code{public} is, naturally, public.  @code{private}
means the method(s) are accessible only when they can be called without an
explicit receiver.  Only @code{self} is allowed to be the receiver of a
private method call.

@code{protected} is the one to be on the lookout for.  A @code{protected}
method can be called from a class or descendant class instances, but also
with another instance as its receiver.  Here is an example (adapted from The
Ruby Language FAQ):

@example
class Test
  # public by default
  def identifier
    99
  end

  def ==(other)
    identifier == other.identifier
  end
end

t1 = Test.new  # => #<Test:0x34ab50>
t2 = Test.new  # => #<Test:0x342784>
t1 == t2       # => true

# now make `identifier' protected; it still works
# because protected allows `other' as receiver

class Test
  protected :identifier
end

t1 == t2  # => true

# now make `identifier' private

class Test
  private :identifier
end

t1 == t2
# NoMethodError: private method `identifier' called for #<Test:0x342784>
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Classes are open
@subsubsection Classes are open
@cindex classes, open

Ruby classes are open.  You can open them up, add to them, and change them at
any time.  Even core classes, like @file{Fixnum} or even @file{Object}, the
parent of all objects.  Ruby on Rails defines a bunch of methods for dealing
with time on @file{Fixnum}.  Watch:

@example
class Fixnum
  def hours
    self * 3600 # number of seconds in an hour
  end
  alias hour hours
end

# 14 hours from 00:00 January 1st
# (aka when you finally wake up ;)
Time.mktime(2006, 01, 01) + 14.hours # => Sun Jan 01 14:00:00
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Funny method names
@subsubsection Funny method names

In Ruby, methods are allowed to end with question marks or exclamation marks.
By convention, methods that answer questions end in question marks
(e.g. @code{Array#empty?}, which returns @code{true} if the receiver is
empty).  Potentially ``dangerous'' methods by convention end with exclamation
marks (e.g. methods that modify @code{self} or the arguments, @code{exit!},
etc.).  Not all methods that change their arguments end with exclamation
marks, though.  @code{Array#replace} replaces the contents of an array with the
contents of another array.  It doesn’t make much sense to have a method like
that that doesn't modify self.

@c _____________________________________

@node Singleton methods
@subsubsection Singleton methods
@cindex singleton methods

@dfn{Singleton methods} are per-object methods.  They are only available on the
Object you defined it on.

@example
class Car
  def inspect
    "Cheap car"
  end
end

porsche = Car.new
porsche.inspect # => Cheap car
def porsche.inspect
  "Expensive car"
end

porsche.inspect # => Expensive car

# Other objects are not affected
other_car = Car.new
other_car.inspect # => Cheap car
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Missing methods
@subsubsection Missing methods
@cindex @code{method_missing} method

Ruby doesn't give up if it can't find a method that responds to a particular
message.  It calls the @code{method_missing} method with the name of the
method it couldn't find and the arguments.  By default, @code{method_missing}
raises a @file{NameError} exception, but you can redefine it to better fit
your application, and many libraries do.  Here is an example:

@example
# id is the name of the method called, the * syntax collects
# all the arguments in an array named 'arguments'
def method_missing(id, *arguments)
  puts "Method #@{id@} was called, but not found. It has " +
       "these arguments: #@{arguments.join(", ")@}"
end

__ :a, :b, 10
# => Method __ was called, but not found. It has these
# arguments: a, b, 10
@end example

The code above just prints the details of the call, but you are free to
handle the message in any way that is appropriate.

@c _____________________________________

@node Message passing --- not function calls
@subsubsection Message passing, not function calls

A method call is really a ``message'' to another object:

@example
# This
1 + 2
# Is the same as this ...
1.+(2)
# Which is the same as this:
1.send "+", 2
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Blocks are Objects
@subsubsection Blocks are Objects
@cindex blocks
@cindex @code{yield}
@cindex @code{Proc}

Blocks (closures, really) are heavily used by the standard library.  To call
a block, you can either use @code{yield}, or make it a @code{Proc} by
appending a special argument to the argument list, like so:

@example
def block(&the_block)
  # Inside here, the_block is the block passed to the method
  the_block # return the block
end
adder = block @{ |a, b| a + b @}
# adder is now a Proc object
adder.class # => Proc
@end example

You can create blocks outside of method calls, too, by calling
@code{Proc.new} with a block or calling the @code{lambda} method.
@cindex @code{lambda} method

Similarly, methods are also Objects in the making:

@example
method(:puts).call "puts is an object!"
# => puts is an object!
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Operators are syntactic sugar
@subsubsection Operators are syntactic sugar

Most operators in Ruby are just syntactic sugar (with some precedence rules)
for method calls.  You can, for example, override @file{Fixnum}’s @code{+}
method:

@example
class Fixnum
  # You can, but please don't do this
  def +(other)
    self - other
  end
end
@end example

You don’t need C++'s @code{operator+}, etc.

You can even have array-style access if you define the @code{[]} and
@code{[]=} methods.  To define the unary @code{+} and @code{-} (think
@samp{+1} and @samp{-2}), you must define the @code{+@@} and @code{-@@}
methods, respectively.  The operators below are not syntactic sugar,
though.  They are not methods, and cannot be redefined:

@example
=, .., ..., not, &&, and, ||, or, ::
@end example

In addition, @samp{+=, *=} etc. are just abbreviations for @samp{var = var +
other_var}, @samp{var = var * other_var}, etc. and therefore cannot be
redefined.

@subsubsection On Simple Examples

@subheading Factorial in Ruby
@cindex factorial in Ruby
@pindex fact.rb

Let's write a function to compute factorials.  The mathematical definition of
@dfn{n factorial} is:

@display
n! = 1                (when n==0)
   = n * (n-1)!       (otherwise)
@end display

In ruby, this can be written as:

@need 400
@anchor{fact-rb}
@cdindex @r{@{@file{fact.rb}@}}, definition
@noindent
@r{@{@file{fact.rb}@}} @equiv{}
@example
# Program to find the factorial of a number
# Save this as fact.rb

def fact(n)
  if n == 0
    1
  else
    n * fact(n-1)
  end
end

puts fact(ARGV[0].to_i)

@end example
@iftex
@smallfonts @rm
@end iftex
@iftex
@textfonts @rm
@end iftex

@subsubheading Command Line Arguments ---  In Array @var{ARGV}
@cindex command line arguments in @code{ARGV}
@cindex @code{to_i} method

@code{ARGV} is an array which contains the command line arguments, and
@code{to_i} converts a character string to an integer.@footnote{Ruby
does not convert strings into integers automatically like perl does.}

@subsubheading The @code{end} Statement

You may notice the repeated occurrence of @code{end}.  Ruby has been called
``Algol-like'' because of this.  (Actually, the syntax of ruby more closely
mimics that of a language named @url{https://www.eiffel.org/,Eiffel}.)

@subsubheading Takeaway --- @code{return} Statement Optional

You may also notice the lack of a @code{return} statement.

@quotation
[A @code{return} statement] is unneeded because @strong{a ruby function
returns the last thing that was evaluated in it}.  Use of a @code{return}
statement here is permissible but unnecessary.
@end quotation
@cindex Algol and Ruby
@cindex Eiffel and Ruby
@cindex @code{return} statement unnecessary

@subsubheading Running @file{fact.rb}

Ruby can deal with any integer which is allowed by your machine's memory.  So
400! can be calculated:

@example
% ruby fact.rb 1
1
% ruby fact.rb 5
120

% ruby fact.rb 40
815915283247897734345611269596115894272000000000

@end example

@subheading The Input/Evaluation Loop

When you invoke ruby with no arguments, it reads commands from standard input
and executes them after the end of input:

@example
% ruby
puts "hello world"
puts "good-bye world"
^D
hello world
good-bye world
@end example

@anchor{RubyEval}
@subsubheading Ruby Evaluation Program --- @file{eval.rb}
@cindex @file{eval.rb}

Ruby also comes with a program called @file{eval.rb} (@pxref{Ruby Eval Utility})
that allows you to enter ruby code from the keyboard in an interactive
loop, showing you the results as you go.  It will be used extensively
through the rest of this guide.  You should use this enhanced
@url{http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/eval.txt, @file{eval.rb}}
that adds visual indenting assistance, warning reports, and color
highlighting.

Here is a short @file{eval.rb} session:

@example
% ruby eval.rb
ruby> puts "Hello, world."
Hello, world.
   nil
ruby> exit
@end example

@samp{hello world} is produced by @code{puts}.  The next line, in this case
@code{nil}, reports on whatever was last evaluated;

@subsubheading No Distinction Between Statement and Expression
@cindex statement vs expression
@cindex expression vs statement

@quotation
Ruby does not distinguish between statements and expressions, so evaluating a
piece of code basically means the same thing as executing it.
@end quotation

Here, @code{nil} indicates that @code{puts} does not return a meaningful
value.  Note that we can leave this interpreter loop by saying
@command{exit}, although @key{C-D} still works too.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Strings
@subsubsection On Strings
@cindex Strings

@subheading Quoting Strings
@cindex strings, quoting syntax and semantics

A string may be double-quoted (@samp{"..."}) or single-quoted (@samp{'...'}).

Double- and single-quoting have different effects in some cases.  A
double-quoted string allows character escapes by a leading backslash, and the
evaluation of embedded expressions using @code{#@{@}}.  A single-quoted string
does not do this interpreting; what you see is what you get.

@subheading String Methods
@cindex string @code{+} and @code{*}

You can concatenate strings with @code{+}, and repeat a string many times with
@code{*}.

Here are some things you can do with strings.

@table @i
@item Concatenation
@samp{word = "fo" + "o"} @result{} @samp{"foo"}
@item Repetition
@samp{word = word * 2} @result{} @samp{"foofoo"}
@item Extracting characters
(note that characters are integers in ruby)@*
@samp{word[0]} @result{} @samp{102} @samp{# 102 is ASCII code of `f'}@*
@samp{word[-1]} @result{} @samp{111} @samp{# 111 is ASCII code of `o'}
@item Extracting substrings
@example
ruby> herb = "parsley"
   "parsley"
ruby> herb[0,1]
   "p"
ruby> herb[-2,2]
   "ey"
ruby> herb[0..3]
   "pars"
ruby> herb[-5..-2]
   "rsle"
@end example
@item Testing for equality:
@samp{"foo" == "foo"} @result{} @samp{true}@*
@samp{"foo" == "bar"} @result{} @samp{false}
@end table

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Puzzle Program
@subsubsection On Puzzle Program
@pindex guess.rb

@need 400
@anchor{guess-rb}
@cdindex @r{@{@file{guess.rb}@}}, definition
@noindent
@r{@{@file{guess.rb}@}} @equiv{}
@example
# save this as guess.rb
words = ['foobar', 'baz', 'quux']
secret = words[rand(3)]

print "guess? "
while guess = STDIN.gets
  guess.chop!
  if guess == secret
    puts "You win!"
    break
  else
    puts "Sorry, you lose."
  end
  print "guess? "
end
puts "The word was ", secret, "."
@end example
@iftex
@smallfonts @rm
@end iftex
@iftex
@textfonts @rm
@end iftex

@subheading New Control Structure @code{while}
@cindex @code{while}

In this program, a new control structure, @code{while}, is used.  The
code between @code{while} and its corresponding @code{end} will
execute repeatedly as long as some specified condition remains true.
In this case, @samp{guess=STDIN.gets} is both an active statement
(collecting a line of user input and storing it as guess), and a
condition (if there is no input, guess, which repesents the value of
the whole @samp{guess=STDIN.gets} expression, has a @code{nil} value,
causing while to stop looping).

@subheading Standard Input Object --- @var{STDIN}
@cindex standard input object @var{stdin}
@cindex @var{stdin}
@cindex @var{stdin}.@code{gets}
@cindex read one line from standard input

@var{STDIN} is the standard input object.  Usually, @samp{guess=gets}
does the same thing as @samp{guess=STDIN.gets}.  In line 5 we read one
line from standard input by the method @var{STDIN}.@code{gets}.  If
@var{EOF} (end of file) occurs while getting the line, @code{gets}
returns @code{nil}.  So the code associated with this @code{while} will
repeat until it sees @key{^D} signifying the end of input.

@subheading @code{guess.chop!}
@cindex @code{guess.chop!}

@code{guess.chop!} in line 6 deletes the last character from
@code{guess}; in this case it will always be a @code{newline}
character, @code{gets} includes that character to reflect the user's
@key{return} keystroke, but we're not interested in it.

@subheading Printing Variables
@cindex @code{puts}

In line 15 we print the secret word.  We have written this as a
@code{puts} (@code{put s}tring) statement with two arguments, which
are printed one after the other; but it would have been equally
effective to do it with a single argument, writing secret as
@code{#@{secret@}} to make it clear that it is a variable to be
evaluated, not a literal word to be printed:

@example
puts "the word is #@{secret@}."
@end example

It builds a single string and presents it as a single argument to
@code{puts}.

@subheading @code{print} vs @code{puts}

Also, we are by now used to the idea of using @code{puts} for standard
script output, but this script uses @code{print} instead, in lines 4
and 13.  They are not quite the same thing.  @code{print} outputs
exactly what it is given; @code{puts} also ensures that the output
line ends.  Using @code{print} in lines 4 and 13 leaves the cursor
next to what was just printed, rather than moving it to the beginning
of the next line.  This creates a recognizable prompt for user
input.  In general, the four output calls below are equivalent:

@subheading Flushing Standard Output
@cindex flush standard output
@cindex buffering

Sometimes a text window is programmed to @emph{buffer} output for the
sake of speed, collecting individual characters and displaying them
only when it is given a @key{newline} character.  So if the guessing
game script misbehaves by not showing the prompt lines until after the
user supplies a guess, @emph{buffering} is the likely culprit.  To
make sure this doesn't happen, you can ``flush'' the output as soon as
you have printed the prompt.  It tells the standard output device (an
object named @var{STDOUT}), ``don't wait; display what you have in your
buffer right now.''  @samp{04 print "guess? "; STDOUT.flush}.  


@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Regular Expressions
@subsubsection Regular Expressions
@cindex regular expressions

@example
ruby> def chab(s)   # "contains hex in angle brackets"
    |    (s =~ /<0(x|X)(\d|[a-f]|[A-F])+>/) != nil
    | end
  nil
ruby> chab "Not this one."
  false
ruby> chab "Maybe this? @{0x35@}"    # wrong kind of brackets
  false
ruby> chab "Or this? <0x38z7e>"    # bogus hex digit
  false
ruby> chab "Okay, this: <0xfc0004>."
  true
@end example

@subheading Program To Help Experiment With Regular Expressions

Here is a little program to help you experiment with regular
expressions.  Store it as @file{regx.rb} and run it by typing @kbd{ruby
regx.rb} at the command line.

The program requires input twice, once for a string and once for a
regular expression.  The string is tested against the regular
expression, then displayed with all the matching parts highlighted in
reverse video.

@pindex @file{regx.rb}
@need 400
@anchor{regx-rb}
@cdindex @r{@{@file{regx.rb}@}}, definition
@noindent
@r{@{@file{regx.rb}@}} @equiv{}
@example
# Requires an ANSI terminal!

st = "\033[7m"
en = "\033[m"

puts "Enter an empty string at any time to exit."

while true
  print "str> "; STDOUT.flush; str = gets.chop
  break if str.empty?
  print "pat> "; STDOUT.flush; pat = gets.chop
  break if pat.empty?
  re = Regexp.new(pat)
  puts str.gsub(re,"#@{st@}\\&#@{en@}")
end
@end example
@iftex
@smallfonts @rm
@end iftex
@iftex
@textfonts @rm
@end iftex

@subheading Explication of @file{regx.rb}

@subsubheading The @code{break} Statement
@cindex @code{break} statement

In line 6, the condition for @code{while} is hardwired to @code{true},
so it forms what looks like an infinite loop.  However we put @code{break}
statements in the 8th and 10th lines to escape the loop.

@subsubheading @code{if} Modifiers
@cindex @code{if} modifier

@example
break if str.empty?
break if pat.empty?
@end example

These two @code{break}s are also an example of @dfn{if modifiers}.  An
@code{if} modifier executes the statement on its left hand side if and
only if the specified condition is satisfied.  This construction is
unusual in that it operates logically from right to left, but it is
provided because for many people it mimics a similar pattern in
natural speech.  It also has the advantage of brevity, as it needs no
@code{end} statement to tell the interpreter how much of the following
code is supposed to be conditional.  An @code{if} modifier is
conventionally used in situations where a statement and condition are
short enough to fit comfortably together on one script line.

Note the difference in the user interface compared to the
string-guessing script.  This one lets the user quit by hitting the
@key{Return} key on an empty line.  We are testing for emptiness of the
input string, not for its nonexistence.

@subsubheading Nondestructive @code{chops} vs Destructive @code{chops!}
@cindex @code{chop}
@cindex @code{chop!}
@cindex destructive method vs nondestructive method

In lines 7 and 9 we have a @dfn{non-destructive} @code{chop}; again,
we're getting rid of the unwanted newline character we always get from
@code{gets}.  Add the exclamation point, and we have a
@dfn{destructive} chop.  What's the difference? In ruby, we
conventionally attach @kbd{!} or @kbd{?} to the end of certain method
names.  The exclamation point (@kbd{!}, sometimes pronounced aloud as
``bang!'') indicates something potentially destructive, that is to
say, something that can change the value of what it touches.
@code{chop!} affects a string directly, but @code{chop} gives you a
chopped copy without damaging the original.

@subsubheading @code{chomp} And @code{chomp!}

You'll also sometimes see @code{chomp} and @code{chomp}! used.  These
are more selective: the end of a string gets bit off only if it
happens to be a newline.  So for example, @code{"XYZ".chomp!} does
nothing.  If you need a trick to remember the difference, think of a
person or animal tasting something before deciding to take a bite, as
opposed to an axe chopping indiscriminately.

@subsubheading Predicate Method Naming Convention
@cindex predicate method
@cindex predicate method naming convention

The other method naming convention appears in lines 8 and 10.  A
question mark (@kbd{?}, sometimes pronounced aloud as ``huh?'')
indicates a @dfn{predicate} method, one that can return either true or
false.

@subsubheading Regular Expressions At Work
@cindex regular expressions at work
@cindex @code{gsub} method

Line 11 creates a regular expression object out of the string supplied
by the user.  The real work is finally done in line 12, which uses
@code{gsub} to globally substitute each match of that expression with
itself, but surrounded by ansi markups; also the same line outputs the
results.

In line 12 we see @code{\\&}.  This is a little tricky.  Since the
replacement string is in double quotes, the pair of backslashes will
be interpreted as a single backslash; what @code{gsub} actually sees
will be @code{\&}, and that happens to be a special code that refers
to whatever matched the pattern in the first place.  So the new string,
when displayed, looks just like the old one, except that the parts
that matched the given pattern are highlighted in inverse video.

@subheading The @code{=~} Matching Operator
@cindex @code{=~} matching operator
@cindex matching operator

@code{=~} is a matching operator with respect to regular expressions;
it returns the position in a string where a match was found, or
@code{nil} if the pattern did not match.

@example
ruby> "abcdef" =~ /d/
   3
ruby> "aaaaaa" =~ /d/
   nil
@end example

@node Ruby User's Guide On Arrays And Hashes
@subsubsection On Arrays And Hashes
@cindex arrays

@subheading Creating An Array
@cindex array, creating

You can create an array by listing some items within square brackets
(@code{[]}) and separating them with commas.  Ruby's arrays can accomodate
diverse object types.  @samp{ary = [1, 2, "3"]} @result{} @samp{[1, 2, "3"]}

@subheading Concatenating and Repeating Arrays
@cindex arrays, concatenating
@cindex arrays, repeating

Arrays can be concatenated or repeated just as strings can.  @samp{ary
+ ["foo", "bar"]} @result{} @samp{[1, 2, "3", "foo", "bar"]};
@samp{ary * 2} @result{} @samp{[1, 2, "3", 1, 2, "3"]}.

@subheading Referring To Elements of Arrays
@cindex array, referring to elements

We can use index numbers to refer to any part of a array.
@samp{ary[0]} @result{} @samp{1}; @samp{ary[0,2]} @result{} @samp{[1, 2]};
@samp{ary[0..1]} @result{} @samp{[1, 2]}.

@subheading Converted To And From Strings
@cindex array, converting to and from string
@cindex @code{join}
@cindex @code{split}

Arrays can be converted to and from strings, using @code{join} and
@code{split} respecitvely.  @samp{str = ary.join(":")} @result{} @samp{"1:2:3"}.
@samp{str.split(":")} @result{} @samp{["1", "2", "3"]}.

@subheading Hashes
@cindex hash
@cindex dictionary
@cindex associative array
@cindex key, for hash

An @dfn{associative array} has elements that are accessed not by
sequential index numbers, but by keys which can have any sort of
value.  Such an array is sometimes called a @dfn{hash} or
@dfn{dictionary}; in the ruby world, we prefer the term hash.  A hash
can be constructed by quoting pairs of items within curly braces
(@code{@{@}}).  You use a key to find something in a hash, much as you
use an index to find something in an array.

@example
ruby> h = @{1 => 2, "2" => "4"@}
   @{1=>2, "2"=>"4"@}
ruby> h[1]
   2
ruby> h["2"]
   "4"
ruby> h[5]
   nil
ruby> h[5] = 10    # appending an entry
   10
ruby> h
   @{5=>10, 1=>2, "2"=>"4"@}
ruby> h.delete 1   # deleting an entry by key
   2
ruby> h[1]
   nil
ruby> h
   @{5=>10, "2"=>"4"@}
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Control Structures
@subsubsection On Control Structures
@cindex control structures

@subheading The @code{case} Statement

We use the @code{case} statement to test a sequence of conditions.
This is superficially similar to @code{switch} in C and Java but is
considerably more powerful, as we shall see.

@example
ruby> i=8
ruby> case i
    | when 1, 2..5
    |   puts "1..5"
    | when 6..10
    |   puts "6..10"
    | end
6..10
   nil
@end example

@subsubheading Testing For A Range Of Values
@cindex range expression

@code{2..5} is an expression which means the @emph{range} between 2
and 5, inclusive.  The following expression tests whether the value of
@code{i} falls within that range: @samp{(2..5) === i}.

@subsubheading The Relationship Operator
@cindex relationship operator @code{===}
@cindex @code{===}

@code{case} internally uses the @emph{relationship} operator
@code{===} to check for several conditions at a time.  In keeping with
ruby's object oriented nature, @code{===} is interpreted suitably for
the object that appeared in the @code{when} condition.

For example, the following code tests string equality in the first
@code{when}, and regular expression matching in the second @code{when}.

@example
ruby> case 'abcdef'
    | when 'aaa', 'bbb'
    |   puts "aaa or bbb"
    | when /def/
    |   puts "includes /def/"
    | end
includes /def/
   nil
@end example
   
@subheading The @code{while} Statement
@cindex @code{while} statement
@cindex loops using @code{while}

Ruby provides convenient ways to construct loops, although you will find in the
next chapter that learning how to use iterators will make it unnecessary to
write explicit loops very often.

A @code{while} is a repeated @code{if}.  We used it in our word-guessing puzzle
and in the regular expression programs (see the previous chapter); there, it
took the form @samp{while condition ... end} surrounding a block of code to be
repeated while condition was true.  But @code{while} and @code{if} can as
easily be applied to individual statements: @samp{puts "It's zero." if i==0}
@result{} @samp{It's zero.} and @samp{puts i+=1 while i<3} @result{} @samp{1 2
3}.

@subsubheading Negated Conditions
@cindex @code{unless}
@cindex @code{until}
@cindex negated conditions

Sometimes you want to negate a test condition.  An @code{unless} is a negated
@code{if}, and an @code{until} is a negated @code{while}.

@subheading Interrupting A Loop
@cindex @code{break}
@cindex @code{next}
@cindex @code{redo}
@cindex @code{return}
@cindex loop interrupts

There are four ways to interrupt the progress of a loop from
inside.

@enumerate
@item
First, @code{break} means, as in C, to escape from the loop entirely.
@item
Second, @code{next} skips to the beginning of the next iteration of
the loop (corresponding to C's continue).
@item
Third, ruby has @code{redo}, which restarts the current iteration.
@item
The fourth way to get out of a loop from the inside is @code{return}.  An
evaluation of @code{return} causes escape not only from a loop but from the
method that contains the loop.  If an argument is given, it will be returned
from the method call, otherwise @code{nil} is returned.
@end enumerate

The following is C code illustrating the meanings of @code{break}, @code{next},
and @code{redo}:

@example
while (condition) @{
label_redo:
   goto label_next;        /* ruby's "next" */
   goto label_break;       /* ruby's "break" */
   goto label_redo;        /* ruby's "redo" */
   ...
   ...
label_next:
@}
label_break:
...
@end example

@subheading The @code{for} Statement
@cindex @code{for} statement
@cindex @code{for} loop
@cindex loop, @code{for}
@cindex collection, looping over elements using @code{for}

C programmers will be wondering by now how to make a @code{for} loop.  Ruby's
@code{for} can serve the same purpose, but adds some flexibility.  The loop
below runs once for each element in a collection (array, hash, numeric
sequence, etc.), but doesn't make the programmer think about indices:

@example
for elt in collection
  # ... here, elt refers to an element of the collection
end
@end example

@cindex collection, looping over a range of values using @code{for}
The collection can be a range of values (this is what most people mean when
they talk about a @code{for} loop):

@example
ruby> for num in (4..6)
    |    puts num
    | end
4
5
6
   4..6
@end example
   
@subsubheading @code{for} Equivalent To @code{each}
@cindex @code{for} equivalent to @code{each}
@cindex @code{each} equivalent to @code{for}
@cindex iterator as substitute for @code{for} loop

But we're getting ahead of ourselves.  @code{for} is really another way of
writing @code{each}, which, it so happens, is our first example of an iterator.
The following two forms are equivalent:

@example
#  If you're used to C or Java, you might prefer this.
for element in collection
  ...
end

#  A Smalltalk programmer might prefer this.
collection.each @{|element|
  ...
@}
@end example

Iterators can often be substituted for conventional loops, and once you get
used to them, they are generally easier to deal with.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Iterators
@subsubsection Ruby User's Guide On Iterators
@cindex iterators, Ruby User's Guide

Iterators are not an original concept with ruby.  They are in common use in
object-oriented languages.  They are also used in Lisp, though there they are
not called iterators.  However the concept of iterator is an unfamiliar one for
many so it should be explained in more detail.

An @dfn{iterator} is something that does the same thing many times.

@subheading Ruby Allows Us To Define Iterators
@cindex iterator, defining

So every OOP language includes some facilities for iteration.  Some languages
provide a special class for this purpose; ruby allows us to define iterators
directly.

@subsubheading Iterators In String
@cindex iterators of String class

Ruby's String type has some useful iterators:

@cindex @code{each_byte}
@code{each_byte} is an iterator for each character in the string.  Each
character is substituted into the local variable c: @samp{"abc".each_byte@{|c|
printf "<%c>", c@}; print "\n"}.

The @code{each_byte} iterator is both conceptually simpler and more likely to
continue to work even if the String class happens to be radically modified in
the future.  One benefit of iterators is that they tend to be robust in the
face of such changes; indeed that is a characteristic of good code in general.

@cindex @code{each_line}
Another iterator of String is @code{each_line}: @samp{"a\nb\nc\n".each_line@{|l| print l@}}.

The tasks that would take most of the programming effort in C (finding line
delimiters, generating substrings, etc.) are easily tackled using iterators.

The @code{for} statement appearing in the previous chapter does iteration by
way of an @code{each} iterator.  String's @code{each} works the same as
@code{each_line}, so let's rewrite the above example with @code{for}:

@example
ruby> for l in "a\nb\nc\n"
    |   print l 
    | end
a
b
c
   nil
@end example

@subheading Control Structures @code{retry} And @code{redo}
@cindex @code{retry}
@cindex @code{redo}
@cindex control structures @code{retry} and @code{redo}

We can use a control structure @code{retry} in conjunction with an iterated
loop, and it will retry the loop from the beginning.  @code{redo} causes just
the current iteration of the loop to be redone.

@subheading @code{yield} In Iterators
@cindex @code{yield}

@code{yield} occurs sometimes in a definition of an iterator.
@dfn{@code{yield}} moves control to the block of code that is passed to the
iterator (this will be explored in more detail in the chapter about procedure
objects).

The following example defines an iterator @code{repeat}, which repeats a block
of code the number of times specified in an argument.

@example
ruby> def repeat(num)
    |   while num > 0
    |     yield
    |     num -= 1
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> repeat(3) @{ puts "foo" @}
foo
foo
foo
   nil
@end example

With @code{retry}, one can define an iterator which works something like ruby's
standard @code{while}.

@example
ruby> def WHILE(cond)
    |   return if not cond
    |   yield
    |   retry
    | end
   nil
ruby> i=0; WHILE(i<3) @{ print i; i+=1 @}
012   nil
@end example

@subheading Summary On Iterarors

There are a few restrictions, but you can write your original iterators; and in
fact, whenever you define a new data type, it is often convenient to define
suitable iterators to go with it.  In this sense, the above examples are not
terribly useful.  We can talk about practical iterators after we have a better
understanding of what classes are.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Object-Oriented Thinking
@subsubsection On Object-Oriented Thinking

Ruby claims to be an object oriented scripting language; but what exactly does
@dfn{object oriented} mean?  Rather than sum it too quickly, let's think for a
moment about the traditional programming paradigm.

Traditionally, a programming problem is attacked by coming up with some kinds
of @emph{data representations}, and @emph{procedures} that operate on that
data.  Under this model, data is inert, passive, and helpless; it sits at the
complete mercy of a large procedural body, which is active, logical, and
all-powerful.

The problem with this approach is that programs are written by programmers, who
are only human and can only keep so much detail clear in their heads at any one
time.  As a project gets larger, its procedural core grows to the point where
it is difficult to remember how the whole thing works.  Minor lapses of
thinking and typographical errors become more likely to result in
well-concealed bugs.  Complex and unintended interactions begin to emerge
within the procedural core, and maintaining it becomes like trying to carry
around an angry squid without letting any tentacles touch your face.  There are
guidelines for programming that can help to minimize and localize bugs within
this traditional paradigm, but there is a better solution that involves
fundamentally changing the way we work.

What object-oriented programming does is to let us delegate most of the mundane
and repetitive logical work to the data itself; it changes our concept of data
from passive to active.  Put another way,

@itemize
@item
We stop treating each piece of data as a box with an open lid that lets us
reach in and throw things around.
@item
We start treating each piece of data as a working machine with a closed lid and
a few well-marked switches and dials.
@end itemize

What is described above as a ``machine'' may be very simple or complex on the
inside; we can't tell from the outside, and we don't allow ourselves to open
the machine up (except when we are absolutely sure something is wrong with its
design), so we are required to do things like flip the switches and read the
dials to interact with the data.  Once the machine is built, we don't want to
have to think about how it operates.

You might think we are just making more work for ourselves, but this approach
tends to do a nice job of preventing all kinds of things from going wrong.

It's worth noting here that the use of an OO language will not enforce proper
OO design.  Indeed it is possible in any language to write code that is
unclear, sloppy, ill-conceived, buggy, and wobbly all over.  What ruby does for
you (as opposed, especially, to C++) is to make the practice of OO programming
feel natural enough that even when you are working on a small scale you don't
feel a necessity to resort to ugly code to save effort.  We will be discussing
the ways in which ruby accomplishes that admirable goal as this guide
progresses; the next topic will be the "switches and dials" (object methods)
and from there we'll move on to the "factories" (classes).

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Methods
@subsubsection On Methods
@cindex methods

@subheading What Is A Method?
@cindex messages to objects

What is a @dfn{method}?  In OO programming, we don't think of operating on data
directly from outside an object; rather, objects have some understanding of how
to operate on themselves (when asked nicely to do so).  You might say we pass
messages to an object, and those messages will generally elicit some kind of an
action or meaningful reply.  This ought to happen without our necessarily
knowing or caring how the object really works inside.  The tasks we are allowed
to ask an object to perform (or equivalently, the messages it understands) are
that object's methods.

@subheading Invoking Methods Of An Object
@cindex invoke method
@cindex method invocation
@cindex dot notation

In ruby, we invoke a method of an object with dot notation (just as in C++ or
Java).  The object being talked to is named to the left of the dot.
@samp{"abcdef".length}.  Intuitively, this string object is being asked how
long it is.  Technically, we are invoking the @code{length} method of the
object @code{abcdef}.

Other objects may have a slightly different interpretation of length, or none
at all.  Decisions about how to respond to a message are made on the fly,
during program execution, and the action taken may change depending on what a
variable refers to.  What we mean by length can vary depending on what object
we are talking about.

@subheading Polymorphism
@cindex polymorphism

An array knows something about what it means to be an array.  Pieces of data in
ruby carry such knowledge with them, so that the demands made on them can
automatically be satisfied in the various appropriate ways.  This relieves the
programmer from the burden of memorizing a great many specific function names,
because a relatively small number of method names, corresponding to concepts
that we know how to express in natural language, can be applied to different
kinds of data and the results will be what we expect.  This feature of OO
programming languages (which, IMHO, Java has done a poor job of exploiting) is
called @dfn{polymorphism}.

@subheading Errors Are Raised
@cindex errors in OO
@cindex raise an error

When an object receives a message that it does not understand, an error is
@dfn{raised}: @samp{ERR: (eval):1: undefined method `length' for 5(Fixnum)}.
So it is necessary to know what methods are acceptable to an object, though we
need not know how the methods are processed.

@subheading Arguments To A Method
@cindex arguments to a method

If arguments are given to a method, they are generally surrounded by
parentheses, @samp{object.method(arg1, arg2)}, but they can be omitted if doing
so does not cause ambiguity, @samp{object.method arg1, arg2}.

@subheading The Special Variable @code{self}
@cindex @code{self}

There is a special variable self in ruby; it refers to whatever object calls a
method.  This happens so often that for convenience the @code{self.} may be
omitted from method calls from an object to itself:
@samp{self.method_name(args...)} is the same as @samp{method_name(args...)}.

What we would think of traditionally as a function call is just this
abbreviated way of writing method invocations by self.  This makes ruby what is
called a pure object oriented language.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Classes
@subsubsection On Classes
@cindex classes
@cindex instance of a class

In OO programming terminology, a category of objects like ``dog'' is called a
class, and some specific object belonging to a class is called an instance of
that class.

@subheading Making An Object From A Class
@cindex class definition
@cindex @code{class} keyword
@cindex @code{end} keyword
@cindex keywords @code{class} and @code{end}
@cindex @code{def} keyword
@cindex keyword @code{def}
@cindex method definition

Generally, to make an object in ruby or any other OO language, first one
defines the characteristics of a class, then creates an instance.  To
illustrate the process, let's first define a simple @code{Dog} class.

@example
ruby> class Dog
    |   def speak
    |     puts "Bow Wow"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
@end example

In ruby, a @dfn{class definition} is a region of code between the keywords
@code{class} and @code{end}.  A @code{def} inside this region begins the
definition of a method of the class, which as we discussed in the previous
chapter, corresponds to some specific behavior for objects of that class.

@subheading Make A New Instance From A Class Definition
@cindex @code{new} keyword
@cindex keyword @code{new}
@cindex instantiating a class

Now that we have defined a @code{Dog} class, we can use it to make a dog:

@example
ruby> pochi = Dog.new
   #<Dog:0xbcb90>
@end example

We have made a new instance of the class @code{Dog}, and have given it the name
@code{pochi}.  The @code{new} method of any class makes a new instance.
Because @code{pochi} is a @code{Dog} according to our class definition, it has
whatever properties we decided a @code{Dog} should have.  Since our idea of
@code{Dog}-ness was very simple, there is just one trick we can ask
@code{pochi} to do.

@example
ruby> pochi.speak
Bow Wow
   nil
@end example

Making a new instance of a class is sometimes called @dfn{instantiating} that
class.  We need to have a dog before we can experience the pleasure of its
conversation; we can't merely ask the @code{Dog} class to bark for us.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Inheritance
@subsubsection On Inheritance
@cindex inheritance
@cindex superclass
@cindex subclass

Our classification of objects in everyday life is naturally hierarchical.  We
know that all cats are mammals, and all mammals are animals.  Smaller classes
@dfn{inherit} characteristics from the larger classes to which they belong.  If
all mammals breathe, then all cats breathe.

We can express this concept in ruby:

@example
ruby> class Mammal
    |   def breathe
    |     puts "inhale and exhale"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> class Cat<Mammal
    |   def speak
    |     puts "Meow"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
@end example

Though we didn't specify how a @code{Cat} should breathe, every cat will
inherit that behavior from the @code{Mammal} class since @code{Cat} was defined
as a subclass of @code{Mammal}.  (In OO terminology, the smaller class is a
@dfn{subclass} and the larger class is a @dfn{superclass}.)  Hence from a
programmer's standpoint, cats get the ability to breathe for free; after we add
a @code{speak} method, our cats can both breathe and speak.

@example
ruby> tama = Cat.new
   #<Cat:0xbd80e8>
ruby> tama.breathe
inhale and exhale
   nil
ruby> tama.speak
Meow
   nil
@end example

@subheading Differential Programming

There will be situations where certain properties of the superclass should not
be inherited by a particular subclass.  Though birds generally know how to fly,
penguins are a flightless subclass of birds.

@example
ruby> class Bird
    |   def preen
    |     puts "I am cleaning my feathers."
    |   end
    |   def fly
    |     puts "I am flying."
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> class Penguin<Bird
    |   def fly
    |     fail "Sorry. I'd rather swim."
    |   end
    | end
   nil
@end example

@cindex differential programming
Rather than exhaustively define every characteristic of every new
class, we need only to append or to redefine the differences between
each subclass and its superclass.  This use of inheritance is
sometimes called @dfn{differential programming}.  It is one of the
benefits of object-oriented programming.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide on Redefinition Of Methods
@subsubsection On Redefinition of Methods
@cindex method redefinition
@cindex redefine a method

In a subclass, we can change the behavior of the instances by
redefining superclass methods.

@example
ruby> class Human
    |   def identify
    |     puts "I'm a person."
    |   end
    |   def train_toll(age)
    |     if age < 12
    |       puts "Reduced fare.";
    |     else
    |       puts "Normal fare.";
    |     end
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> Human.new.identify
I'm a person.
   nil
ruby> class Student1<Human
    |   def identify
    |     puts "I'm a student."
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> Student1.new.identify
I'm a student.
   nil
@end example

@cindex @code{super}
Suppose we would rather enhance the superclass's @code{identify} method than
entirely replace it.  For this we can use @code{super}.

@example
ruby> class Student2<Human
    |   def identify
    |     super
    |     puts "I'm a student too."
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> Student2.new.identify
I'm a person.
I'm a student too.
   nil
@end example
   
@code{super} lets us pass arguments to the original method.  It is sometimes
said that there are two kinds of people @dots{}

@example
ruby> class Dishonest<Human
    |   def train_toll(age)
    |     super(11) # we want a cheap fare.
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> Dishonest.new.train_toll(25)
Reduced fare. 
   nil

ruby> class Honest<Human
    |   def train_toll(age)
    |     super(age) # pass the argument we were given
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> Honest.new.train_toll(25)
Normal fare. 
   nil
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Access Control
@subsubsection On Access Control
@cindex access control

Earlier, we said that ruby has no functions, only methods.  However there is
more than one kind of method.  In this chapter we introduce @dfn{access
controls}.

Consider what happens when we define a method in the ``top level'', not inside
a class definition.  We can think of such a method as analogous to a function
in a more traditional language like C.

@example
ruby> def square(n)
    |   n * n
    | end
   nil
ruby> square(5)
   25
@end example
   
Our new method would appear not to belong to any class, but in fact ruby gives
it to the @code{Object} class, which is a superclass of every other class.  As
a result, any object should now be able to use that method.  That turns out to
be true, but there's a small catch: it is a @emph{private} method of every
class.  We'll discuss some of what this means below, but one consequence is
that it may be invoked only in function style, as here:

@example
ruby> class Foo
    |   def fourth_power_of(x)
    |     square(x) * square(x)
    |   end
    | end
  nil
ruby> Foo.new.fourth_power_of 10
  10000
@end example
  
We are not allowed to explicitly apply the method to an object:

@example
ruby> "fish".square(5)
ERR: (eval):1: private method `square' called for "fish":String
@end example

This rather cleverly preserves ruby's pure-OO nature (functions are still
object methods, but the receiver is self implicitly) while providing functions
that can be written just as in a more traditional language.

@subheading Rationale For Private Methods: Encapsulation

A common mental discipline in OO programming, which we have hinted at in an
earlier chapter, concerns the separation of specification and implementation,
or what tasks an object is supposed to accomplish and how it actually
accomplishes them.  The internal workings of an object should be kept generally
hidden from its users; they should only care about what goes in and what comes
out, and trust the object to know what it is doing internally.  As such it is
often helpful for classes to have methods that the outside world does not see,
but which are used internally (and can be improved by the programmer whenever
desired, without changing the way users see objects of that class).  In the
trivial example below, think of engine as the invisible inner workings of the
class.

@example
ruby> class Test
    |   def times_two(a)
    |     puts "#@{a@} times two is #@{engine(a)@}"
    |   end
    |   def engine(b)
    |     b*2
    |   end
    |   private:engine  # this hides engine from users
    | end
   Test
ruby> test = Test.new
   #<Test:0x4017181c>
ruby> test.engine(6)
ERR: (eval):1: private method `engine' called for #<Test:0x4017181c>
ruby> test.times_two(6)
6 times two is 12.
   nil
@end example
   
We might have expected @code{test.engine(6)} to return 12, but instead we learn
that @code{engine} is inaccessible when we are acting as a user of a
@code{Test} object.  Only other @code{Test} methods, such as @code{times_two},
are allowed to use engine.  We are required to go through the public interface,
which consists of the @code{times_two} method.  The programmer who is in charge
of this class can change @code{engine} freely (here, perhaps by changing
@code{b*2} to @code{b+b}, assuming for the sake of argument that it improved
performance) without affecting how the user interacts with @code{Test} objects.
This example is of course much too simple to be useful; the benefits of access
controls become more clear only when we begin to create more complicated and
interesting classes.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Singleton Methods
@subsubsection On Singleton Methods
@cindex singleton methods

The behavior of an instance is determined by its class, but there may be times
we know that a particular instance should have special behavior.  In most
languages, we must go to the trouble of defining another class, which would
then only be instantiated once.  In ruby we can give any object its own
methods.  A method given only to a single object is called a @dfn{singleton
method}.

Singleton methods are often used for elements of a graphic user interface
(GUI), where different actions need to be taken when different buttons are
pressed.

@cindex prototype-based languages
@cindex CLOS
@cindex Dylan
@cindex Self
@cindex NewtonScript
Singleton methods are not unique to ruby, as they appear in CLOS, Dylan, etc.
Also, some languages, for example, Self and NewtonScript, have singleton
methods only.  These are sometimes called @dfn{prototype-based} languages.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Modules
@subsubsection On Modules
@cindex modules

Modules in ruby are similar to classes, except:

@itemize
@item
A module can have no instances.
@item
A module can have no subclasses.
@item
A module is defined by @code{module @dots{} end}.
@end itemize

Actually... the @code{Module} class of @code{module} is the superclass of the
@code{Class} class of @code{class}.  Got that?  No?  Let's move on.

@subheading Module As Collection

There are two typical uses of modules.  One is to collect related methods and
constants in a central location.  The @code{Math} module in ruby's standard
library plays such a role:

@example
ruby> Math.sqrt(2)
   1.41421
ruby> Math::PI
   3.14159
@end example

@cindex @code{::} operator
@cindex @code{include} statement
The @code{::} operator tells the ruby interpreter which module it should
consult for the value of a constant (conceivably, some module besides Math
might mean something else by PI).  If we want to refer to the methods or
constants of a module directly without using @code{::}, we can @code{include}
that module:

@example
ruby> include Math
   Object
ruby> sqrt(2)
   1.41421
ruby> PI
   3.14159
@end example

@subheading Module As Mixin
@cindex mixin
@cindex multiple inheritance

Another use of modules is called @dfn{mixin}.  Some OO programming languages,
including C++, allow @dfn{multiple inheritance}, that is, inheritance from more
than one superclass.  A real-world example of multiple inheritance is an alarm
clock; you can think of alarm clocks as belonging to the class of clocks and
also the class of things with buzzers.

@cindex mixin technique
@cindex include a module, mixin
Ruby purposely does not implement true multiple inheritance, but the @dfn{mixin
technique} is a good alternative.  Remember that modules cannot be instantiated
or subclassed; but if we @code{include} a module in a class definition, its
methods are effectively appended, or @emph{mixed in}, to the class.

@subsubheading Mixin As Properties

Mixin can be thought of as a way of asking for whatever particular properties
we want to have.  For example, if a class has a working @code{each} method,
mixing in the standard library's @code{Enumerable} module gives us @code{sort}
and @code{find} methods for free.

@subsubheading Modules Instead Of Multiple Inheritance

This use of modules gives us the basic functionality of multiple inheritance
but allows us to represent class relationships with a simple tree structure,
and so simplifies the language implementation considerably (a similar choice
was made by the designers of Java).

@node Ruby User's Guide On Procedure Objects
@subsubsection On Procedure Objects (Procs)
@cindex procedure objects
@cindex Procs
@cindex @code{proc}

It is often desirable to be able to specify responses to unexpected events.  As
it turns out, this is most easily done if we can pass blocks of code as
arguments to other methods, which means we want to be able to treat code as if
it were data.

A new procedure object is formed using @code{proc}:

@example
ruby> quux = proc @{
    |   puts "QUUXQUUXQUUX!!!"
    | @}
   #<Proc:0x4017357c>
@end example

@cindex @code{call} method
@cindex Proc, invoke
@cindex @code{proc}, execute
Now what @code{quux} refers to is an object, and like most objects, it has
behavior that can be invoked.  Specifically, we can ask it to execute, via its
@code{call} method:

@example
ruby> quux.call
QUUXQUUXQUUX!!!
   nil
@end example

@cindex Proc as method argument
So, after all that, can @code{quux} be used as a method argument?
Sure.

@example
ruby> def run( p )
    |   puts "About to call a procedure..."
    |   p.call
    |   puts "There: finished."
    | end
   nil
ruby> run quux
About to call a procedure...
QUUXQUUXQUUX!!!
There: finished.
   nil
@end example

@cindex @code{trap} method, and Proc
The @code{trap} method lets us assign the response of our choice to
any system signal.

@example
ruby> inthandler = proc@{ puts "^C was pressed." @}
   #<Proc:0x401730a4>
ruby> trap "SIGINT", inthandler
   #<Proc:0x401735e0>
@end example

Normally pressing @key{^C} makes the interpreter quit.  Now a message is
printed and the interpreter continues running, so you don't lose the work you
were doing.  (You're not trapped in the interpreter forever; you can still exit
by typing @kbd{exit}.)

@subheading Anonymous Procedure Objects
@cindex anonymous procedure objects

A final note before we move on to other topics: it's not strictly necessary to
give a procedure object a name before binding it to a signal.  An equivalent
anonymous procedure object would look like @samp{trap "SIGINT", proc@{ puts "^C
was pressed." @}}, or more compactly still, @samp{ trap "SIGINT", 'puts "^C was
pressed."'}.  This abbreviated form provides some convenience and readability
when you write small anonymous procedures.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Variables
@subsubsection On Variables
@cindex variables, description

Ruby has three kinds of variables, one kind of constant and exactly two
pseudo-variables.  The variables and the constants have no type.  While untyped
variables have some drawbacks, they have many more advantages and fit well with
ruby's quick and easy philosophy.

@subheading No Variable Declarations

Variables must be declared in most languages in order to specify their type,
modifiability (i.e., whether they are constants), and scope; since type is not
an issue, and the rest is evident from the variable name as you are about to
see, we do not need variable declarations in ruby.

The first character of an identifier categorizes it at a glance:

@float Table,table:variable-identifiers
@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@item $          @tab   global variable
@item @@         @tab   instance variable
@item [a-z] or _ @tab   local variable
@item [A-Z]      @tab   constant
@end multitable
@caption{List of Variable Identifiers}
@end float

@subheading Pseudo-Variables
@cindex pseudo-variables @code{self} and @code{nil}

The only exceptions to the above are ruby's pseudo-variables: @code{self},
which always refers to the currently executing object, and @code{nil}, which is
the meaningless value assigned to uninitialized variables.  Both are named as
if they are local variables, but @code{self} is a global variable maintained by
the interpreter, and @code{nil} is really a constant.  As these are the only
two exceptions, they don't confuse things too much.

You may not assign values to @code{self} or @code{nil}.  @code{main}, as a
value of @code{self}, refers to the top-level object.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Global Variables
@subsubsection On Global Variables
@cindex global variables
@cindex variables, global

A @dfn{global variable} has a name beginning with @code{$}.  It can be referred
to from anywhere in a program.  Before initialization, a global variable has the
special value @code{nil}.

Global variables should be used sparingly.  They are dangerous because they can
be written to from anywhere.  Overuse of globals can make isolating bugs
difficult; it also tends to indicate that the design of a program has not been
carefully thought out.  Whenever you do find it necessary to use a global
variable, be sure to give it a descriptive name that is unlikely to be
inadvertently used for something else later (calling it something like $foo as
above is probably a bad idea).

@subheading Global Variables Can Be Traced
@cindex global variable, tracing
@cindex active variable
@cindex variable, active

One nice feature of a global variable is that it can be traced; you can specify
a procedure which is invoked whenever the value of the variable is changed.

@example
ruby> trace_var :$x, proc@{puts "$x is now #@{$x@}"@}
   nil
ruby> $x = 5
$x is now 5
   5
@end example

When a global variable has been rigged to work as a trigger to invoke a
procedure whenever changed, we sometimes call it an @dfn{active variable}.  For
instance, it might be useful for keeping a GUI display up to date.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Instance Variables
@subsubsection On Instance Variables
@cindex instance variables
@cindex variable, instance

An instance variable has a name beginning with @code{@@}, and its scope is
confined to whatever object @code{self} refers to.  Two different objects, even
if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for
their instance variables.  From outside the object, instance variables cannot
be altered or even observed (i.e., ruby's instance variables are never
@code{public}) except by whatever methods are explicitly provided by the
programmer.  As with globals, instance variables have the @code{nil} value
until they are initialized.

@subheading Instance Variables Are Not Declared

Instance variables do not need to be declared.  This indicates a flexible object
structure; in fact, each instance variable is dynamically appended to an object
when it is first assigned.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Local Variables
@subsubsection On Local Variables
@cindex local variables
@cindex variable, local

A local variable has a name starting with a lower case letter or an underscore
character (@code{_}).  Local variables do not, like globals and instance variables,
have the value @code{nil} before initialization.

The first assignment you make to a local variable acts something like a
declaration.  If you refer to an uninitialized local variable, ruby will report
an error: @samp{ERR: (eval):1: undefined local variable or method `foo' for
main(Object)}.

Generally, the scope of a local variable is one of:
@cindex scope of local variable
@cindex local variable scope

@itemize
@item
@code{proc@{ ... @}}
@item
@code{loop@{ ... @}}
@item
@code{def ... end}
@item
@code{class ... end}
@item
@code{module ... end}
@item
the entire script (unless one of the above applies)
@end itemize

@cindex @code{defined?} operator
@code{defined?} is an operator which checks whether an identifier is defined.
It returns a description of the identifier if it is defined, or @code{nil}
otherwise.

Procedure objects that live in the same scope share whatever local variables
also belong to that scope.  Here, the local variable @code{bar} is shared by
@code{main} and the procedure objects @code{p1} and @code{p2}:

@example
ruby> bar=nil
   nil
ruby> p1 = proc@{|n| bar=n@}
   #<Proc:0x8deb0>
ruby> p2 = proc@{bar@}
   #<Proc:0x8dce8>
ruby> p1.call(5)
   5
ruby> bar
   5
ruby> p2.call
   5
@end example

Note that the @code{bar=nil} at the beginning cannot be omitted; it ensures
that the scope of bar will encompass @code{p1} and @code{p2}.  Otherwise
@code{p1} and @code{p2} would each end up with its own local variable bar, and
calling @code{p2} would have resulted in an @samp{undefined local variable or
method} error.  We could have said @code{bar=0} instead, but using @code{nil}
is a courtesy to others who will read your code later.  It indicates fairly
clearly that you are only establishing scope, because the value being assigned
is not intended to be meaningful.

@subheading @code{Proc} Objects Are Closures
@cindex closures, @code{proc} objects

A powerful feature of procedure objects follows from their ability to be passed
as arguments: shared local variables remain valid even when they are passed out
of the original scope.

@example
ruby> def box
    |   contents = nil
    |   get = proc@{contents@}
    |   set = proc@{|n| contents = n@}
    |   return get, set
    | end
   nil
ruby> reader, writer = box
   [#<Proc:0x40170fc0>, #<Proc:0x40170fac>] 
ruby> reader.call
   nil
ruby> writer.call(2)
   2
ruby> reader.call
   2
@end example

Ruby is particularly smart about scope.  It is evident in our example that the
@code{contents} variable is being shared between the @code{reader} and
@code{writer}.  But we can also manufacture multiple @code{reader-writer} pairs
using @code{box} as defined above; each pair shares a @code{contents} variable,
and the pairs do not interfere with each other.

@example
ruby> reader_1, writer_1 = box
   [#<Proc:0x40172820>, #<Proc:0x4017280c>]
ruby> reader_2, writer_2 = box
   [#<Proc:0x40172668>, #<Proc:0x40172654>]
ruby> writer_1.call(99)
   99
ruby> reader_1.call
   99
ruby> reader_2.call  # nothing is in this box yet
   nil
@end example

This kind of programming could be considered a perverse little object-oriented
framework.  The @code{box} method acts something like a class, with @code{get}
and @code{set} serving as methods (except those aren't really the method names,
which could vary with each box instance) and @code{contents} being the lone
instance variable.  Of course, using ruby's legitimate class framework leads to
much more readable code.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Class Constants
@subsubsection On Class Constants
@cindex class constants
@cindex constant, class

A constant has a name starting with an uppercase character.  It should be
assigned a value at most once.  In the current implementation of ruby,
reassignment of a constant generates a warning but not an error (the non-ANSI
version of @code{eval.rb} does not report the warning).

@subheading Class Constants Accessible Outside Class

Constants may be defined within classes, but unlike instance variables, they
are accessible outside the class.
@cindex class constants, access to

@example
ruby> class ConstClass
    |   C1=101
    |   C2=102
    |   C3=103
    |   def show
    |     puts "#@{C1@} #@{C2@} #@{C3@}"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> C1
ERR: (eval):1: uninitialized constant C1
ruby> ConstClass::C1
   101
ruby> ConstClass.new.show
101 102 103
   nil
@end example

@cindex modules, class constants
@cindex class constants in modules
Constants can also be defined in modules.

@example
ruby> module ConstModule
    |   C1=101
    |   C2=102
    |   C3=103
    |   def showConstants
    |     puts "#@{C1@} #@{C2@} #@{C3@}"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> C1
ERR: (eval):1: uninitialized constant C1
ruby> include ConstModule
   Object
ruby> C1
   101
ruby> showConstants
101 102 103
   nil
ruby> C1=99  # not really a good idea
   99
ruby> C1
   99
ruby> ConstModule::C1
   101
ruby> ConstModule::C1=99   # .. this was not allowed in earlier versions
   (eval):1: warning: already initialized constant C1

@node Ruby User's Guide On Exception Processing And @code{rescue}
@subsubsection On Exception Processing and @code{rescue}
@cindex exception processing
@cindex @code{rescue}

An executing program can run into unexpected problems.  A file that it wants to
read might not exist; the disk might be full when it wants to save some data;
the user may provide it with some unsuitable kind of input.

A robust program will handle these situations sensibly and gracefully.  Meeting
that expectation can be an exasperating task.  C programmers are expected to
check the result of every system call that could possibly fail, and immediately
decide what is to be done.

This is such a tiresome practice that programmers can tend to grow careless and
neglect it, and the result is a program that doesn't handle exceptions well.  On
the other hand, doing the job right can make programs hard to read, because
there is so much error handling cluttering up the meaningful code.

@subheading @code{begin} And @code{rescue} Blocks

In ruby, as in many modern languages, we can handle exceptions for blocks of
code in a compartmentalized way, thus dealing with surprises effectively but
not unduly burdening either the programmer or anyone else trying to read the
code later.  The block of code marked with @code{begin} executes until there is
an exception, which causes control to be transferred to a block of error
handling code, which is marked with @code{rescue}.  If no exception occurs, the
@code{rescue} code is not used.  The following method returns the first line of
a text file, or @code{nil} if there is an exception:

@example
def first_line( filename )
  begin
    file = open("some_file")
    info = file.gets
    file.close
    info  # Last thing evaluated is the return value
  rescue
    nil   # Can't read the file? then don't return a string
  end
end
@end example

There will be times when we would like to be able to creatively work around a
problem.  Here, if the file we want is unavailable, we try to use standard input
instead:

@example
begin
  file = open("some_file")
rescue
  file = STDIN
end

begin
  # ... process the input ...
rescue
  # ... and deal with any other exceptions here.
end
@end example

@cindex @code{retry}
@code{retry} can be used in the @code{rescue} code to start the @code{begin}
code over again.  It lets us rewrite the previous example a little more
compactly:

@example
fname = "some_file"
begin
  file = open(fname)
  # ... process the input ...
rescue
  fname = "STDIN"
  retry
end
@end example

@subheading @code{raise}ing Exceptions
@cindex @code{raise} exception
@cindex global variable @code{$!}
@cindex @code{$!}

Every ruby library raises an exception if any error occurs, and you can raise
exceptions explicitly in your code too.  To raise an exception, use
@code{raise}.  It takes one argument, which should be a string that describes
the exception.  The argument is optional but should not be omitted.  It can be
accessed later via the special global variable @code{$!}.

@example
ruby> raise "test error"
   test error
ruby> begin
    |   raise "test2"
    | rescue
    |   puts "An error occurred: #@{$!@}"
    | end
An error occurred: test2
   nil
@end example

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Exception Processing and @code{ensure}
@subsubsection On Exception Processing And @code{ensure}
@cindex exception processing
@cindex @code{ensure}

There may be cleanup work that is necessary when a method finishes its
work.  Perhaps an open file should be closed, buffered data should be flushed,
etc.  If there were always only one exit point for each method, we could
confidently put our cleanup code in one place and know that it would be
executed; however, a method might return from several places, or our intended
cleanup code might be unexpectedly skipped because of an exception.

For this reason we add another keyword to the @code{begin...rescue...end}
scheme, which is @code{ensure}.  The @code{ensure} code block executes
regardless of the success or failure of the @code{begin} block.

@example
file = open("/tmp/some_file", "w")
begin
  # ... write to the file ...
rescue
  # ... handle the exceptions ...
ensure
  file.close   # ... and this always happens.
end
@end example

It is possible to use @code{ensure} without @code{rescue}, or vice versa, but
if they are used together in the same @code{begin...end} block, the
@code{rescue} must precede the @code{ensure}.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Accessors
@subsubsection On Accessors
@cindex accessors
@cindex attributes
@cindex instance variabes, as attributes
@cindex attribute accessors
@cindex writer accessor
@cindex reader accessor

We briefly discussed instance variables in an earlier chapter, but haven't done
much with them yet.  An object's instance variables are its @dfn{attributes},
the things that distinguish it from other objects of the same class.  It is
important to be able to write and read these attributes; doing so requires
methods called attribute accessors.  We'll see in a moment that we don't always
have to write accessor methods explicitly, but let's go through all the motions
for now.  The two kinds of accessors are writers and readers.

@subheading Accessors: Writers And Readers

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def set_kind(k)  # a writer
    |     @@kind = k
    |   end
    |   def get_kind     # a reader
    |     @@kind
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f1 = Fruit.new
   #<Fruit:0xfd7e7c8c>
ruby> f1.set_kind("peach")  # use the writer
   "peach"
ruby> f1.get_kind           # use the reader
   "peach"
ruby> f1                    # inspect the object
   #<Fruit:0xfd7e7c8c @@kind="peach">
@end example

Simple enough; we can store and retrieve information about what kind of fruit
we're looking at.  But our method names are a little wordy.  The following is
more concise, and more conventional:

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def kind=(k)
    |     @@kind = k
    |   end
    |   def kind
    |     @@kind
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f2 = Fruit.new
   #<Fruit:0xfd7e7c8c>
ruby> f2.kind = "banana"
   "banana"
ruby> f2.kind
   "banana"
@end example
   
@subheading The @code{inspect} Method
@cindex @code{inspect} method

A short digression is in order.  You've noticed by now that when we try to look
at an object directly, we are shown something cryptic like
@samp{#<anObject:0x83678>}.  This is just a default behavior, and we are free
to change it.  All we need to do is add a method named @code{inspect}.  It
should return a string that describes the object in some sensible way,
including the states of some or all of its instance variables.

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def inspect
    |     "a fruit of the #@{@@kind@} variety"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f2
   "a fruit of the banana variety"
@end example

@subheading @code{to_s} And @code{p} Methods
@cindex @code{to_s} method
@cindex @code{p} method

A related method is @code{to_s} (convert to string), which is used when
printing an object.  In general, you can think of @code{inspect} as a tool for
when you are writing and debugging programs, and @code{to_s} as a way of
refining program output.  @file{eval.rb} (@pxref{Ruby Eval Utility} uses
@code{inspect} whenever it displays results.  You can use the @code{p} method
to easily get debugging output from programs.

@example
# These two lines are equivalent:
p anObject
puts anObject.inspect
@end example

@subheading Making Accessors
@cindex accessors, using shortcuts

Since many instance variables need accessor methods, Ruby provides convenient
shortcuts for the standard forms.

@float Table,table:accessor-shortcuts
@multitable @columnfractions .35 .65
@headitem Shortcut @tab Effect
@item
attr_reader :v @tab def v; @v; end
@item
attr_writer :v @tab def v=(value); @v=value; end
@item
attr_accessor :v @tab attr_reader :v; attr_writer :v
@item
attr_accessor :v, :w @tab attr_accessor :v; attr_accessor :w
@end multitable
@caption{List of Accessor Shortcuts}
@end float

Let's take advantage of this and add freshness information.  First we ask for an
automatically generated reader and writer, and then we incorporate the new
information into @code{inspect}:

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   attr_accessor :condition
    |   def inspect
    |     "a #@{@@condition@} #@{@@kind@}"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f2.condition = "ripe"
   "ripe"
ruby> f2
   "a ripe banana"
@end example

If nobody eats our ripe fruit, perhaps we should let time take its toll.

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def time_passes
    |     @@condition = "rotting"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f2
   "a ripe banana"
ruby> f2.time_passes
   "rotting"
ruby> f2
   "a rotting banana"
@end example

But while playing around here, we have introduced a small problem.  What happens
if we try to create a third piece of fruit now?  Remember that instance
variables don't exist until values are assigned to them.

@example
ruby> f3 = Fruit.new
ERR: failed to convert nil into String
@end example

It is the @code{inspect} method that is complaining here, and with good reason.
We have asked it to report on the kind and condition of a piece of fruit, but
as yet @code{f3} has not been assigned either attribute.  If we wanted to, we
could rewrite the @code{inspect} method so it tests instance variables using
the @code{defined?}  method and then only reports on them if they exist, but
maybe that's not very useful; since every piece of fruit has a kind and
condition, it seems we should make sure those always get defined somehow.  That
is the topic of the next chapter.

@c _____________________________________

@node Ruby User's Guide On Object Initialization
@subsubsection On Object Initialization
@cindex initialization of objects
@cindex @code{initialize} method

Our @code{Fruit} class from the previous chapter had two instance variables,
one to describe the kind of fruit and another to describe its condition.  It
was only after writing a custom @code{inspect} method for the class that we
realized it didn't make sense for a piece of fruit to lack those
characteristics.  Fortunately, ruby provides a way to ensure that instance
variables always get initialized.

@subheading Default Argument Values in @code{initialize}
@cindex default argument values
@cindex argument values, setting default values

Whenever Ruby creates a new object, it looks for a method named
@code{initialize} and executes it.  So one simple thing we can do is use an
@code{initialize} method to put default values into all the instance variables,
so the @code{inspect} method will have something to say.

There will be times when a default value doesn't make a lot of sense.  Is there
such a thing as a default kind of fruit?  It may be preferable to require that
each piece of fruit have its kind specified at the time of its creation.  To do
this, we would add a formal argument to the @code{initialize} method.  For
reasons we won't get into here, arguments you supply to @code{new} are actually
delivered to @code{initialize}.

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def initialize( k )
    |     @@kind = k
    |     @@condition = "ripe"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f5 = Fruit.new "mango"
   "a ripe mango"
ruby> f6 = Fruit.new
ERR: (eval):1:in `initialize': wrong # of arguments(0 for 1)
@end example

Above we see that once an argument is associated with the @code{initialize}
method, it can't be left off without generating an error.  If we want to be more
considerate, we can use the argument if it is given, or fall back to default
values otherwise.

@example
ruby> class Fruit
    |   def initialize( k="apple" )
    |     @@kind = k
    |     @@condition = "ripe"
    |   end
    | end
   nil
ruby> f5 = Fruit.new "mango"
   "a ripe mango"
ruby> f6 = Fruit.new
   "a ripe apple"
@end example

You can use @dfn{default argument values} for any method, not just @code{initialize}.
The argument list must be arranged so that those with default values come last.

@subheading Object Reflection, Variable-Length Argument Lists, Method Overloading
@cindex reflection
@cindex variable-length argument lists
@cindex argument lists, variable length
@cindex method overloading

Sometimes it is useful to provide several ways to initialize an
object.  Although it is outside the scope of this tutorial, ruby supports object
reflection and variable-length argument lists, which together effectively allow
method overloading.

@node Ruby User's Guide On Nuts And Bolts
@subsubsection On Nuts And Bolts

@subheading Statement Delimiters
@cindex statement delimiters

Some languages require some kind of punctuation, often a semicolon (@kbd{;}),
to end each statement in a program.  Ruby instead follows the convention used
in shells like @command{sh} and @command{csh}.  Multiple statements on one line
must be separated by semicolons, but they are not required at the end of a
line; a linefeed is treated like a semicolon.  If a line ends with a backslash
(@kbd{\}), the linefeed following it is ignored; this allows you to have a
single logical line that spans several lines.

@subheading Comments
@cindex comments

Why write comments?  Although well written code tends to be self-documenting,
it is often helpful to scribble in the margins, and it can be a mistake to
believe that others will be able to look at your code and immediately see it
the way you do.  Besides, for practical purposes, you yourself are a different
person within a few days anyway; which of us hasn't gone back to fix or enhance
a program after the passage of time and said, I know I wrote this, but what in
blazes does it mean?

Some experienced programmers will point out, quite correctly, that
contradictory or outdated comments can be worse than none at all.  Certainly,
comments shouldn't be a substitute for readable code; if your code is unclear,
it's probably also buggy.  You may find that you need to comment more while you
are learning ruby, and then less as you become better at expressing your ideas
in simple, elegant, readable code.

Ruby follows a common scripting convention, which is to use a pound symbol
(@kbd{#}) to denote the start of a comment.  Anything following an unquoted
@kbd{#}, to the end of the line on which it appears, is ignored by the
interpreter.

Also, to facilitate large comment blocks, the ruby interpreter also ignores
anything between a line starting with @kbd{=begin} and another line starting
with @kbd{=end}.

@example
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin
**********************************************************************
  This is a comment block, something you write for the benefit of
  human readers (including yourself).  The interpreter ignores it.
  There is no need for a '#' at the start of every line.
**********************************************************************
=end
@end example

@subheading Organizing Your Code

Ruby's unusually high level of dynamism means that classes, modules, and
methods exist only after their defining code runs.  If you're used to
programming in a more static language, this can sometimes lead to surprises.

@example
# The below results in an "undefined method" error:

puts successor(3)

def successor(x)
  x + 1
end
@end example

Although the interpreter checks over the entire script file for syntax before
executing it, the @code{def successor ... end} code has to actually run in
order to create the @code{successor} method.  So the order in which you arrange
a script can matter.

This does not, as it might seem at first glance, force you to organize your
code in a strictly bottom-up fashion.  When the interpreter encounters a method
definition, it can safely include undefined references, as long as you can be
sure they will be defined by the time the method is actually invoked:

@example
# Conversion of fahrenheit to celsius, broken
# down into two steps.

def f_to_c(f)
  scale(f - 32.0)  # This is a forward reference, but it's okay.
end

def scale(x)
  x * 5.0 / 9.0
end

printf "%.1f is a comfortable temperature.\n", f_to_c(72.3)
@end example

So while this may seem less convenient than what you may be used to in Perl or
Java, it is less restrictive than trying to write C without prototypes (which
would require you to always maintain a partial ordering of what references
what).  Putting top-level code at the bottom of a source file always works.
And even this is less of an annoyance than it might at first seem.  A sensible
and painless way to enforce the behavior you want is to define a @code{main}
function at the top of the file, and call it from the bottom.

@example
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def main
  # Express the top level logic here...
end

# ... put support code here, organized as you see fit ...

main # ... and start execution here.
@end example

@subheading @code{load} And @code{require}

@cindex @code{include}
@cindex @code{require}
@cindex @code{load}
It also helps that ruby provides tools for breaking complicated programs into
readable, reusable, logically related chunks.  We have already seen the use of
@code{include} for accessing modules (@pxref{Ruby User's Guide On Modules}.
You will also find the @code{load} and @code{require} facilities useful.

@table @code
@item load
works as if the file it refers to were copied and pasted in
(something like the @code{#include} preprocessor directive in C).
@item require
is somewhat more sophisticated, causing code to be loaded at
most once and only when needed.

@subheading The Programmatic Programmer's Guide

@url{http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/,Programming Ruby}

@subsubheading What This Book Is

This book is a tutorial and reference for the Ruby programming language.  Use
Ruby, and you'll write better code, be more productive, and enjoy programming
more.

@subsubheading What Ruby Is

Take a true object-oriented language, such as Smalltalk.  Drop the unfamiliar
syntax and move to more conventional, file-based source code.  Now add in a
good measure of the flexibility and convenience of languages such as Python
and Perl.

You end up with Ruby.

@subsubheading Ruby is OO

OO aficionados will find much to like in Ruby:  things such as pure object
orientation (everything's an object), metaclasses, closures, iterators, and
ubiquitous heterogeneous collections.  Smalltalk users will feel right at home
(and C++ and Java users will feel jealous).

@subsubheading Ruby is Perl and Python

At the same time, Perl and Python wizards will find many of their favorite
features:  full regular expression support, tight integration with the
underlying operating system, convenient shortcuts, and dynamic evaluation.

@subsubheading Principle of Lease Surprise

Ruby follows the Principle of Least Surprise --- things work the way you
would expect them to, with very few special cases or exceptions.

@subsubheading Ruby is a ``Transparent'' Language

We call Ruby a ``transparent'' language.  By that we mean that Ruby doesn't
obscure the solutions you write behind lots of syntax and the need to churn
out reams of support code just to get simple things done.  With Ruby you write
programs close to the problem domain.  Rather than constantly mapping your
ideas and designs down to the pedestrian level of most languages, with Ruby
you'll find you can express them directly and express them elegantly.  This
means you code faster.  It also means your programs stay readable and
maintainable.

@subsubheading Ruby is a ``Scripting'' Language

What exactly is a scripting language?  Frankly we don't know if it's a
distinction worth making.  In Ruby, you can access all the underlying
operating system features.  You can do the same stuff in Ruby that you can in
Perl or Python, and you can do it more cleanly.  But Ruby is fundamentally
different.  It is a true programming language, too, with strong theoretical
roots and an elegant, lightweight syntax.  You could hack together a mess of
``scripts'' with Ruby, but you probably won't.  Instead, you'll be more
inclined to engineer a solution, to produce a program that is easy to
understand, simple to maintain, and a piece of cake to extend and reuse in
the future.

@subsubheading Ruby is a General Purpose Programming Language

Although we have used Ruby for scripting jobs, most of the time we use it as
a general-purpose programming language.  We've used it to write GUI
applications and middle-tier server processes, and we're using it to format
large parts of this book.  Others have used it for managing server machines
and databases.  Ruby is serving Web pages, interfacing to databases and
generating dynamic content.  People are writing artificial intelligence and
machine learning programs in Ruby, and at least one person is using it to
investigate natural evolution.  Ruby's finding a home as a vehicle for
exploratory mathematics.  And people all over the world are using it as a way
of gluing together all their different applications.  It truly is a great
language for producing solutions in a wide variety of problem domains.

@subsubheading Should I Use Ruby?

However, Ruby is probably more applicable than you might think.  It is easy to
extend, both from within the language and by linking in third-party
libraries.  It is portable across a number of platforms.  It's relatively
lightweight and consumes only modest system resources.  And it's easy to
learn; we've known people who've put Ruby code into production systems within
a day of picking up drafts of this book.  We've used Ruby to implement parts
of an X11 window manager, a task that's normally considered severe C
coding.  Ruby excelled, and helped us write code in hours that would otherwise
have taken days.

assist with constructing @acronym{URL}'s if I am lucky.  I am writing it using

@node Makefile Default Rule
@appendixsec Default Rule

The @code{default} rule is to create a @acronym{PDF} document and all
@acronym{HTML} files.  This assumes that the @acronym{TEXI} file has been
generated and updated by hand first.  Therefore, the target @code{TWJR} will
run both @command{jrtangle} and @command{jrweave}, while the target
@code{WEAVE} or alternatively @code{TEXI} will run just @command{jrweave} on
the @file{.twjr} file.  Thereafter, you can update the @file{.texi} file and
run the @code{default}.
