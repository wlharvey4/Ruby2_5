<h4 class="subsubsection">2.4.1.9 On Object-Oriented Thinking</h4>

<p>Ruby claims to be an object oriented scripting language; but what exactly does
<em>object oriented</em> mean?  Rather than sum it too quickly, let&rsquo;s think for a
moment about the traditional programming paradigm.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, a programming problem is attacked by coming up with some kinds
of <em>data representations</em>, and <em>procedures</em> that operate on that
data.  Under this model, data is inert, passive, and helpless; it sits at the
complete mercy of a large procedural body, which is active, logical, and
all-powerful.
</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that programs are written by programmers, who
are only human and can only keep so much detail clear in their heads at any one
time.  As a project gets larger, its procedural core grows to the point where
it is difficult to remember how the whole thing works.  Minor lapses of
thinking and typographical errors become more likely to result in
well-concealed bugs.  Complex and unintended interactions begin to emerge
within the procedural core, and maintaining it becomes like trying to carry
around an angry squid without letting any tentacles touch your face.  There are
guidelines for programming that can help to minimize and localize bugs within
this traditional paradigm, but there is a better solution that involves
fundamentally changing the way we work.
</p>
<p>What object-oriented programming does is to let us delegate most of the mundane
and repetitive logical work to the data itself; it changes our concept of data
from passive to active.  Put another way,
</p>
<ul>
<li> We stop treating each piece of data as a box with an open lid that lets us
reach in and throw things around.
</li><li> We start treating each piece of data as a working machine with a closed lid and
a few well-marked switches and dials.
</li></ul>

<p>What is described above as a &ldquo;machine&rdquo; may be very simple or complex on the
inside; we can&rsquo;t tell from the outside, and we don&rsquo;t allow ourselves to open
the machine up (except when we are absolutely sure something is wrong with its
design), so we are required to do things like flip the switches and read the
dials to interact with the data.  Once the machine is built, we don&rsquo;t want to
have to think about how it operates.
</p>
<p>You might think we are just making more work for ourselves, but this approach
tends to do a nice job of preventing all kinds of things from going wrong.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting here that the use of an OO language will not enforce proper
OO design.  Indeed it is possible in any language to write code that is
unclear, sloppy, ill-conceived, buggy, and wobbly all over.  What ruby does for
you (as opposed, especially, to C++) is to make the practice of OO programming
feel natural enough that even when you are working on a small scale you don&rsquo;t
feel a necessity to resort to ugly code to save effort.  We will be discussing
the ways in which ruby accomplishes that admirable goal as this guide
progresses; the next topic will be the &quot;switches and dials&quot; (object methods)
and from there we&rsquo;ll move on to the &quot;factories&quot; (classes).
