<a name="On-Access-Control"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.4.1.14 On Access Control</h4>
<a name="index-access-control-1"></a>

<p>Earlier, we said that ruby has no functions, only methods.  However there is
more than one kind of method.  In this chapter we introduce <em>access
controls</em>.
</p>
<p>Consider what happens when we define a method in the &ldquo;top level&rdquo;, not inside
a class definition.  We can think of such a method as analogous to a function
in a more traditional language like C.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ruby&gt; def square(n)
    |   n * n
    | end
   nil
ruby&gt; square(5)
   25
</pre></div>
   
<p>Our new method would appear not to belong to any class, but in fact ruby gives
it to the <code>Object</code> class, which is a superclass of every other class.  As
a result, any object should now be able to use that method.  That turns out to
be true, but there&rsquo;s a small catch: it is a <em>private</em> method of every
class.  We&rsquo;ll discuss some of what this means below, but one consequence is
that it may be invoked only in function style, as here:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ruby&gt; class Foo
    |   def fourth_power_of(x)
    |     square(x) * square(x)
    |   end
    | end
  nil
ruby&gt; Foo.new.fourth_power_of 10
  10000
</pre></div>
  
<p>We are not allowed to explicitly apply the method to an object:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ruby&gt; &quot;fish&quot;.square(5)
ERR: (eval):1: private method `square' called for &quot;fish&quot;:String
</pre></div>

<p>This rather cleverly preserves ruby&rsquo;s pure-OO nature (functions are still
object methods, but the receiver is self implicitly) while providing functions
that can be written just as in a more traditional language.
</p>
<a name="Rationale-For-Private-Methods_003a-Encapsulation"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Rationale For Private Methods: Encapsulation</h4>

<p>A common mental discipline in OO programming, which we have hinted at in an
earlier chapter, concerns the separation of specification and implementation,
or what tasks an object is supposed to accomplish and how it actually
accomplishes them.  The internal workings of an object should be kept generally
hidden from its users; they should only care about what goes in and what comes
out, and trust the object to know what it is doing internally.  As such it is
often helpful for classes to have methods that the outside world does not see,
but which are used internally (and can be improved by the programmer whenever
desired, without changing the way users see objects of that class).  In the
trivial example below, think of engine as the invisible inner workings of the
class.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ruby&gt; class Test
    |   def times_two(a)
    |     puts &quot;#{a} times two is #{engine(a)}&quot;
    |   end
    |   def engine(b)
    |     b*2
    |   end
    |   private:engine  # this hides engine from users
    | end
   Test
ruby&gt; test = Test.new
   #&lt;Test:0x4017181c&gt;
ruby&gt; test.engine(6)
ERR: (eval):1: private method `engine' called for #&lt;Test:0x4017181c&gt;
ruby&gt; test.times_two(6)
6 times two is 12.
   nil
</pre></div>
   
<p>We might have expected <code>test.engine(6)</code> to return 12, but instead we learn
that <code>engine</code> is inaccessible when we are acting as a user of a
<code>Test</code> object.  Only other <code>Test</code> methods, such as <code>times_two</code>,
are allowed to use engine.  We are required to go through the public interface,
which consists of the <code>times_two</code> method.  The programmer who is in charge
of this class can change <code>engine</code> freely (here, perhaps by changing
<code>b*2</code> to <code>b+b</code>, assuming for the sake of argument that it improved
performance) without affecting how the user interacts with <code>Test</code> objects.
This example is of course much too simple to be useful; the benefits of access
controls become more clear only when we begin to create more complicated and
interesting classes.
