<h4 class="subsection">2.4.3 Programming Ruby</h4>

<a name="The-Programmatic-Programmer_0027s-Guide"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">The Programmatic Programmer&rsquo;s Guide</h4>

<p><a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby</a>
</p>
<a name="What-This-Book-Is"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">What This Book Is</h4>

<p>This book is a tutorial and reference for the Ruby programming language.  Use
Ruby, and you&rsquo;ll write better code, be more productive, and enjoy programming
more.
</p>
<a name="What-Ruby-Is"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">What Ruby Is</h4>

<p>Take a true object-oriented language, such as Smalltalk.  Drop the unfamiliar
syntax and move to more conventional, file-based source code.  Now add in a
good measure of the flexibility and convenience of languages such as Python
and Perl.
</p>
<p>You end up with Ruby.
</p>
<a name="Ruby-is-OO"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ruby is OO</h4>

<p>OO aficionados will find much to like in Ruby:  things such as pure object
orientation (everything&rsquo;s an object), metaclasses, closures, iterators, and
ubiquitous heterogeneous collections.  Smalltalk users will feel right at home
(and C++ and Java users will feel jealous).
</p>
<a name="Ruby-is-Perl-and-Python"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ruby is Perl and Python</h4>

<p>At the same time, Perl and Python wizards will find many of their favorite
features:  full regular expression support, tight integration with the
underlying operating system, convenient shortcuts, and dynamic evaluation.
</p>
<a name="Principle-of-Lease-Surprise"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Principle of Lease Surprise</h4>

<p>Ruby follows the Principle of Least Surprise &mdash; things work the way you
would expect them to, with very few special cases or exceptions.
</p>
<a name="Ruby-is-a-_0060_0060Transparent_0027_0027-Language"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ruby is a &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; Language</h4>

<p>We call Ruby a &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; language.  By that we mean that Ruby doesn&rsquo;t
obscure the solutions you write behind lots of syntax and the need to churn
out reams of support code just to get simple things done.  With Ruby you write
programs close to the problem domain.  Rather than constantly mapping your
ideas and designs down to the pedestrian level of most languages, with Ruby
you&rsquo;ll find you can express them directly and express them elegantly.  This
means you code faster.  It also means your programs stay readable and
maintainable.
</p>
<a name="Ruby-is-a-_0060_0060Scripting_0027_0027-Language"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ruby is a &ldquo;Scripting&rdquo; Language</h4>

<p>What exactly is a scripting language?  Frankly we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a
distinction worth making.  In Ruby, you can access all the underlying
operating system features.  You can do the same stuff in Ruby that you can in
Perl or Python, and you can do it more cleanly.  But Ruby is fundamentally
different.  It is a true programming language, too, with strong theoretical
roots and an elegant, lightweight syntax.  You could hack together a mess of
&ldquo;scripts&rdquo; with Ruby, but you probably won&rsquo;t.  Instead, you&rsquo;ll be more
inclined to engineer a solution, to produce a program that is easy to
understand, simple to maintain, and a piece of cake to extend and reuse in
the future.
</p>
<a name="Ruby-is-a-General-Purpose-Programming-Language"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ruby is a General Purpose Programming Language</h4>

<p>Although we have used Ruby for scripting jobs, most of the time we use it as
a general-purpose programming language.  We&rsquo;ve used it to write GUI
applications and middle-tier server processes, and we&rsquo;re using it to format
large parts of this book.  Others have used it for managing server machines
and databases.  Ruby is serving Web pages, interfacing to databases and
generating dynamic content.  People are writing artificial intelligence and
machine learning programs in Ruby, and at least one person is using it to
investigate natural evolution.  Ruby&rsquo;s finding a home as a vehicle for
exploratory mathematics.  And people all over the world are using it as a way
of gluing together all their different applications.  It truly is a great
language for producing solutions in a wide variety of problem domains.
</p>
<a name="Should-I-Use-Ruby_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Should I Use Ruby?</h4>

<p>However, Ruby is probably more applicable than you might think.  It is easy to
extend, both from within the language and by linking in third-party
libraries.  It is portable across a number of platforms.  It&rsquo;s relatively
lightweight and consumes only modest system resources.  And it&rsquo;s easy to
learn; we&rsquo;ve known people who&rsquo;ve put Ruby code into production systems within
a day of picking up drafts of this book.  We&rsquo;ve used Ruby to implement parts
of an X11 window manager, a task that&rsquo;s normally considered severe C
coding.  Ruby excelled, and helped us write code in hours that would otherwise
have taken days.
