<h4 class="subsubsection">2.4.1.27 On Nuts And Bolts</h4>

<a name="Statement-Delimiters"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Statement Delimiters</h4>
<a name="index-statement-delimiters"></a>

<p>Some languages require some kind of punctuation, often a semicolon (<kbd>;</kbd>),
to end each statement in a program.  Ruby instead follows the convention used
in shells like <code>sh</code> and <code>csh</code>.  Multiple statements on one line
must be separated by semicolons, but they are not required at the end of a
line; a linefeed is treated like a semicolon.  If a line ends with a backslash
(<kbd>\</kbd>), the linefeed following it is ignored; this allows you to have a
single logical line that spans several lines.
</p>
<a name="Comments"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Comments</h4>
<a name="index-comments"></a>

<p>Why write comments?  Although well written code tends to be self-documenting,
it is often helpful to scribble in the margins, and it can be a mistake to
believe that others will be able to look at your code and immediately see it
the way you do.  Besides, for practical purposes, you yourself are a different
person within a few days anyway; which of us hasn&rsquo;t gone back to fix or enhance
a program after the passage of time and said, I know I wrote this, but what in
blazes does it mean?
</p>
<p>Some experienced programmers will point out, quite correctly, that
contradictory or outdated comments can be worse than none at all.  Certainly,
comments shouldn&rsquo;t be a substitute for readable code; if your code is unclear,
it&rsquo;s probably also buggy.  You may find that you need to comment more while you
are learning ruby, and then less as you become better at expressing your ideas
in simple, elegant, readable code.
</p>
<p>Ruby follows a common scripting convention, which is to use a pound symbol
(<kbd>#</kbd>) to denote the start of a comment.  Anything following an unquoted
<kbd>#</kbd>, to the end of the line on which it appears, is ignored by the
interpreter.
</p>
<p>Also, to facilitate large comment blocks, the ruby interpreter also ignores
anything between a line starting with <kbd>=begin</kbd> and another line starting
with <kbd>=end</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin
**********************************************************************
  This is a comment block, something you write for the benefit of
  human readers (including yourself).  The interpreter ignores it.
  There is no need for a '#' at the start of every line.
**********************************************************************
=end
</pre></div>

<a name="Organizing-Your-Code"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Organizing Your Code</h4>

<p>Ruby&rsquo;s unusually high level of dynamism means that classes, modules, and
methods exist only after their defining code runs.  If you&rsquo;re used to
programming in a more static language, this can sometimes lead to surprises.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># The below results in an &quot;undefined method&quot; error:

puts successor(3)

def successor(x)
  x + 1
end
</pre></div>

<p>Although the interpreter checks over the entire script file for syntax before
executing it, the <code>def successor ... end</code> code has to actually run in
order to create the <code>successor</code> method.  So the order in which you arrange
a script can matter.
</p>
<p>This does not, as it might seem at first glance, force you to organize your
code in a strictly bottom-up fashion.  When the interpreter encounters a method
definition, it can safely include undefined references, as long as you can be
sure they will be defined by the time the method is actually invoked:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># Conversion of fahrenheit to celsius, broken
# down into two steps.

def f_to_c(f)
  scale(f - 32.0)  # This is a forward reference, but it's okay.
end

def scale(x)
  x * 5.0 / 9.0
end

printf &quot;%.1f is a comfortable temperature.\n&quot;, f_to_c(72.3)
</pre></div>

<p>So while this may seem less convenient than what you may be used to in Perl or
Java, it is less restrictive than trying to write C without prototypes (which
would require you to always maintain a partial ordering of what references
what).  Putting top-level code at the bottom of a source file always works.
And even this is less of an annoyance than it might at first seem.  A sensible
and painless way to enforce the behavior you want is to define a <code>main</code>
function at the top of the file, and call it from the bottom.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def main
  # Express the top level logic here...
end

# ... put support code here, organized as you see fit ...

main # ... and start execution here.
</pre></div>

<a name="load-And-require"></a>
<h4 class="subheading"><code>load</code> And <code>require</code></h4>

<a name="index-include"></a>
<a name="index-require-2"></a>
<a name="index-load-1"></a>
<p>It also helps that ruby provides tools for breaking complicated programs into
readable, reusable, logically related chunks.  We have already seen the use of
<code>include</code> for accessing modules (see section <a href="Ruby-User_0027s-Guide-On-Modules.html#Ruby-User_0027s-Guide-On-Modules">On Modules</a>.
You will also find the <code>load</code> and <code>require</code> facilities useful.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>load</code></dt>
<dd><p>works as if the file it refers to were copied and pasted in
(something like the <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive in C).
</p></dd>
<dt><code>require</code></dt>
<dd><p>is somewhat more sophisticated, causing code to be loaded at
most once and only when needed.
</p></dd>
</dl>
