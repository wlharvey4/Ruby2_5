Typographical Conventions
=========================

This Info file is written in an enhanced version of Texinfo
(http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/), the GNU documentation
formatting language.  A single Texinfo source file is used to produce
both the printed and online versions of a program's documentation.

   Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the
common shell primary and secondary prompts, '$' and '>'.  Input that
you type is shown 'like this'.  Output from the command is preceded by
the glyph "-|".  This typically represents the command's standard
output.  Error messages, and other output on the command's standard
error, are preceded by the glyph "error->".  For example:

     $ echo hi on stdout
     -| hi on stdout
     $ echo hello on stderr 1>&2
     error-> hello on stderr

1 Introduction
**************

Ruby is ...

   A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on
simplicity and productivity.  It has an elegant syntax that is natural
to read and easy to write.

2.1 Installing Ruby
===================

Installation Methods
--------------------

There are several ways to install Ruby:

   * Package Manager: When you are on a UNIX-like operating system,
     using your system’s package manager is the easiest way of getting
     started.  However, the packaged Ruby version usually is not the
     newest one.
   * Installers: can be used to install a specific or multiple Ruby
     versions.  There is also an installer for Windows.
   * Managers help you to switch between multiple Ruby installations
     on your system.
   * Source: And finally, you can also build Ruby from source.

   The following overview lists available installation methods for
different needs and platforms.

File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: Package Management Systems,  Next: Installers,  Up: Installing Ruby

2.1.1 Package Management Systems
--------------------------------

If you cannot compile your own Ruby, and you do not want to use a
third-party tool, you can use your system’s package manager to install
Ruby.

   Certain members in the Ruby community feel very strongly that you
should never use a package manager to install Ruby and that you should
use tools instead.  While the full list of pros and cons is outside of
the scope of this page, the most basic reason is that most package
managers have older versions of Ruby in their official repositories.
If you would like to use the newest Ruby, make sure you use the
correct package name, or use the tools described further below
instead.

* Menu:

* Homebrew (OS X)::


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: Homebrew (OS X),  Up: Package Management Systems

2.1.1.1 Homebrew (OS X)
.......................

Homebrew (http://brew.sh/)

   On macOS (High) Sierra and OS X El Capitan, Ruby 2.0 is included.

   Many people on OS X use Homebrew as a package manager.  It is
really easy to get a newer version of Ruby using Homebrew:

     $ brew install ruby

   This should install the latest Ruby version.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: Installers,  Next: Managers,  Prev: Package Management Systems,  Up: Installing Ruby

2.1.2 Installers
----------------

If the version of Ruby provided by your system or package manager is
out of date, a newer one can be installed using a third-party
installer.  Some of them also allow you to install multiple versions
on the same system; associated managers can help to switch between the
different Rubies.  If you are planning to use RVM as a version manager
you do not need a separate installer, it comes with its own.

* Menu:

* ruby-build::
* ruby-install::


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: ruby-build,  Next: ruby-install,  Up: Installers

2.1.2.1 'ruby-build'
....................

'ruby-build' (https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme)

   'rbenv'
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rbenv)

   'ruby-build' is a plugin for 'rbenv' (*note rbenv:: that allows you
to compile and install different versions of Ruby into arbitrary
directories.  'ruby-build' can also be used as a standalone program
without 'rbenv'.  It is available for OS X, Linux, and other UNIX-like
operating systems.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: ruby-install,  Prev: ruby-build,  Up: Installers

2.1.2.2 'ruby-install'
......................

'ruby-install' version manager 'chruby' version switcher

   'ruby-install' (https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#readme)

   'chruby'
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#chruby)

   'ruby-install' allows you to compile and install different versions
of Ruby into arbitrary directories.  There is also a sibling, 'chruby'
(*note chruby::), which handles switching between Ruby versions.  It
is available for OS X, Linux, and other UNIX-like operating systems.

2.1.3 Managers
--------------

Many Rubyists use Ruby managers to manage multiple Rubies.  They
confer various advantages but are not officially supported.  Their
respective communities are very helpful, however.

* Menu:

* chruby::
* rbenv::
* RVM (``Ruby Version Manager'')::
* uru::


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: chruby,  Next: rbenv,  Up: Managers

2.1.3.1 chruby
..............

'chruby' allows you to switch between multiple Rubies.  'chruby' can
manage Rubies installed by 'ruby-install' (*note ruby-install::) or
even built from source.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: rbenv,  Next: RVM (``Ruby Version Manager''),  Prev: chruby,  Up: Managers

2.1.3.2 'rbenv'
...............

'rbenv' (https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme)

   'ruby-build'
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#ruby-build)

   'rbenv' allows you to manage multiple installations of Ruby.  It
does not support installing Ruby, but there is a popular plugin named
'ruby-build' (*note ruby-build::) to install Ruby.  Both tools are
available for OS X, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating systems.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: RVM (``Ruby Version Manager''),  Next: uru,  Prev: rbenv,  Up: Managers

2.1.3.3 RVM ("Ruby Version Manager")
....................................

RVM (http://rvm.io/)

   RVM allows you to install and manage multiple installations of Ruby
on your system.  It can also manage different gemsets.  It is
available for OS X, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating systems.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: uru,  Prev: RVM (``Ruby Version Manager''),  Up: Managers

2.1.3.4 'uru'
.............

Uru (https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru)

   Uru is a lightweight, multi-platform command line tool that helps
you to use multiple Rubies on OS X, Linux, or Windows systems.


File: Ruby2_5.info,  Node: Building From Source,  Prev: Managers,  Up: Installing Ruby

2.1.4 Building From Source
--------------------------

Ruby 2.5.1 (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

   Ruby Github (https://github.com/ruby/ruby)

   Of course, you can install Ruby from source.  Download and unpack a
tarball, then just do this:

     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

   By default, this will install Ruby into '/usr/local'.  To change,
pass the '--prefix=DIR' option to the './configure' script.

   Using the third-party tools or package managers might be a better
idea, though, because the installed Ruby won’t be managed by any
tools.

   Installing from the source code is a great solution for when you
are comfortable enough with your platform and perhaps need specific
settings for your environment.  It’s also a good solution in the event
that there are no other premade packages for your platform.
